  "cost of 12.1 cents per kilowatt-hour and an average gasoline price",
  "of $2.83 per gallon over the full ownership of the vehicle which were the average electricity cost",
  "electricity cost and premium gasoline price in the United States,",
  "respectively, for December 2014, and based on our estimate of the energy efficiency of Model S, we",
  "of Model S, we estimate that our Model S could save approximately",
  "$1,600 per year less in fuel costs than a comparable premium internal combustion engine sedan. In",
  "engine sedan. In international markets, where gasoline prices can be",
  "2-3 times those of the United States, the savings are greater.",
  "We have designed Model S with an adaptable platform architecture and common electric powertrain",

  "addition, based on internal testing, we estimate that the Model S would have",
  "an approximate 5-10% reduction in range when operated continuously in 0\u00b0C temperatures.",
  "To date, we have tested hundreds of battery cells of different chemistries, form factors and",
  "form factors and designs. Based on this evaluation, we are presently",
  "using lithium-ion battery cells based on the 18650 form factor in all of our battery packs. We",

  "Power Electronics",
  "The power electronics in our electric powertrain govern the flow of electrical current throughout",
  "current throughout the car, primarily the current that flows into",
  "and out of the battery pack. The power electronics have two primary functions, the control of",
  "the control of torque generation in the motor while driving and the",
  "control of energy delivery back into the battery pack while charging.",
  "The first function is accomplished through the drive inverter, which converts direct current (DC)",
  "direct current (DC) from the battery pack into alternating current",
  "(AC) to drive our three-phase induction motors. The drive inverter also converts the AC generated",
  "the AC generated by regenerative braking back into DC for electrical",
  "storage in the battery pack. The drive inverter performs this function by using a high-performance",
  "a high-performance digital signal processor which runs some of the most",
  "complicated and detailed software in the vehicle. In so doing, the drive inverter is directly",
  "is directly responsible for the performance, high efficiency and overall",
  "driving experience of the vehicle.",
  "The second function, charging the battery pack, is accomplished by the charger, which converts",
  "which converts alternating current (usually from a wall outlet or",
  "other electricity source) into direct current that can be accepted by the battery. Tesla vehicles",
  "Tesla vehicles can recharge on a variety of AC electrical sources, from a",
  "common outlet to a high power circuit of up to 22kW, which provides faster recharging. Vehicles in",
  "Vehicles in both the United States and Europe come with the",
  "Tesla Mobile Connector which enables charging from a variety of different outlets. In other",
  "outlets. In other markets, Tesla offers a Tesla Wall Connector that can be",
  "hardwired at a wide range of power levels to suit the electrical capabilities of the charging",
  "of the charging location.",
  "The most common home charging system uses a standard high power and Mobile Connector to charge",
  "Connector to charge overnight.  On the road, customers can",
  "also charge using our Supercharger network or at a variety of destinations that have deployed our",
  "have deployed our charging equipment.  In addition, Model S vehicles",
  "can also charge at a variety of public charging stations around the world, either natively or",

  "7",
  "Vehicle Control and Infotainment Software",
  "The performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs require sophisticated",
  "sophisticated control software. There are numerous",
  "processors in our vehicles to control these functions, and we write custom firmware for many of",
  "for many of these processors. The flow of electricity between the",
  "battery pack and the motor must be tightly controlled in order to deliver the performance and",
  "the performance and behavior expected in the vehicle. For example, software",
  "algorithms enable the vehicle to mimic the \u201ccreep\u201d feeling which drivers expect from an internal",
  "from an internal combustion engine vehicle without having to apply",
  "pressure on the accelerator. Similar algorithms control traction, vehicle stability and the",
  "stability and the sustained acceleration and regenerative braking of the vehicle.",
  "Software also is used extensively to monitor the charge state of each of the cells of the battery",
  "of the battery pack and to manage all of its safety systems. Drivers use",
  "the information and control systems in our vehicles to optimize performance, customize vehicle",
  "customize vehicle behavior, manage charging modes and times and control",
  "all infotainment functions. We develop almost all of this software, including most of the user",

  "We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, advanced",
  "vehicles, advanced electric vehicle powertrain components and",
  "stationary energy storage applications. We are currently producing and selling our second vehicle,",
  "our second vehicle, the Model S sedan. Model S is a four door, five-",
  "passenger premium sedan that offers exceptional performance, functionality and attractive styling.",
  "attractive styling. The Model S inherited many of the electric",
  "powertrain innovations we introduced with our first vehicle, the Tesla Roadster.  We commenced",
  "We commenced deliveries of Model S in June 2012 and have delivered",
  "56,768 vehicles through December 31, 2014. We recently announced the availability of our All-Wheel",
  "of our All-Wheel Drive Dual Motor Model S and began delivery,",
  "starting with a performance-optimized version, in December 2014.",
  "We are continuing to develop our Model X crossover vehicle and intend to commence customer",
  "commence customer deliveries in the third quarter of 2015. After the",
  "Model X, our goal is to introduce Model 3, a lower priced sedan designed for the mass market, in",
  "the mass market, in 2017.",
  "Our primary source of revenue is from the sale of our vehicles. During the year ended December 31,",
  "ended December 31, 2014, we recognized total revenues of $3.20",
  "billion, an increase of $1.19 billion over total revenues of $2.01 billion for the year ended",
  "for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily driven by growth of Model S",
  "deliveries worldwide.",
  "Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 27.6%, a significant increase from 22.7% for",
  "from 22.7% for the year ended December 31, 2013.",

  "Orders, Production and Deliveries",
  "Our orders for Model S in 2014 significantly increased from the prior year as we expanded our",
  "as we expanded our operations internationally and introduced Model S",
  "product enhancements.  In October 2014, we revealed our All-Wheel Drive Dual Motor Model S and our",
  "Model S and our Autopilot system. This version of Model S",
  "proved very popular, leading to over 10,000 unfulfilled orders as of January 1, 2015.  We expect",
  "1, 2015.  We expect that demand for Model S will continue to increase",
  "worldwide as more people drive and become aware of our vehicles, as we grow our customer support",
  "customer support infrastructure, and as we broaden the appeal of",
  "our products.",
  "As of December 31, 2014, we had received almost 20,000 reservations for Model X in advance of its",
  "X in advance of its planned introduction later this year.  We are",
  "continuing to test the Beta Model X prototypes, and plan to begin building and testing a small",
  "and testing a small fleet of release candidate Model X vehicles later in the",
  "first quarter of 2015.  Our ability to launch the Model X program on time and cost efficiently is",
  "cost efficiently is dependent upon a variety of factors, including",
  "completion of production tooling, supplier readiness, engineering completion and the successful",
  "and the successful completion of our validation testing.",
  "In order to meet this anticipated demand for both Model S and Model X, we are executing a plan to",
  "executing a plan to increase our combined Model S and Model X",
  "production capacity to over 2,000 units per week by the end of 2015. In August 2014, we began our",
  "2014, we began our production ramp by transitioning to our new final",
  "assembly line and upgrading our body center. We are planning further investments in production",
  "in production capacity during 2015, including building a new paint",
  "shop and a new body shop for Model X. We expect our annual production will increase by over 50%",
  "by over 50% each year for the next several years.",
  "47",
  "Our recent production capacity expansion contributed to several weeks of production in excess of",
  "in excess of 1,000 vehicles per week during the last few",
  "months of 2014. However, the changeover to our new final assembly line during the third quarter of",
  "third quarter of 2014 and the introduction of All-Wheel Drive Dual",
  "Motor Model S onto this line during the fourth quarter of 2014 took longer than we expected.",
  "than we expected.  Consequently, we delivered fewer vehicles than we had",
  "planned in 2014.  During 2015, we plan to achieve significant efficiencies in Model S production",
  "Model S production and begin production of Model X with the intent of",
  "achieving a significantly faster initial production ramp than we achieved with Model S.  Any",
  "with Model S.  Any unexpected issues with the expansion of our production",
  "capacity or the launch and ramp of Model X production could affect our ability to meet future",
  "to meet future delivery targets.",
  "In addition to expanding our production, we expect to continue to lower the cost of manufacturing",
  "of manufacturing our vehicles and improve our gross",
  "margin.  Significant cost improvements for Model S were achieved in 2013 and 2014, including part",
  "including part cost reductions as well as manufacturing",
  "efficiencies. We expect that this trend will continue as we execute on our roadmap. We expect that",
  "We expect that such improvements, when combined with a favorable",
  "mix of vehicles, will allow us to achieve a 30% gross margin on Model S by the end of 2015,",
  "by the end of 2015, assuming no further deterioration in foreign",
  "currencies.  However, we expect these cost improvements will be partially offset by production",
  "by production inefficiencies during the introduction of Model",
  "X.  During our product introductions in 2014, we incurred manufacturing inefficiencies which",
  "which negatively impacted our gross margin.  When we",
  "introduce Model X, we expect that both production inefficiencies and supply chain inefficiencies",
  "inefficiencies typical of a new product introduction will suppress",
  "Model X margins for at least a few quarters after its introduction.  If we are not able to achieve",
  "not able to achieve the planned cost reductions from our various cost",
  "savings and process improvement initiatives or introduce Model X efficiently, our ability to reach",
  "ability to reach our gross margin goals would be negatively affected.",
  "We expect to deliver approximately 55,000 Model S and X vehicles worldwide in 2015, approximately",
  "2015, approximately 74% more deliveries than we achieved in",
  "2014.  To support this growth, we plan to continue to expand our Supercharger, stores and service",
  "stores and service infrastructure worldwide as well as to provide better",
  "service in areas with a high concentration of Model S customers.  As we now offer Model S in",
  "offer Model S in countries throughout North America, Europe and Asia,",
  "our expansion will primarily occur in geographic areas in which we already have a presence.  Based",
  "a presence.  Based on our current projections, we expect our long-term",
  "sales outside of North America will increase to almost half of our worldwide automotive sales.",
  "automotive sales.  Despite initial challenges in China, we plan to continue to",
  "invest in our infrastructure in China as we believe that the country could be one of our largest",
  "one of our largest markets within a few years.  However, as compared to",
  "markets in the United States and Europe, we have relatively limited experience in Asian markets;",
  "in Asian markets; thus, we may face continuing difficulties meeting our",
  "future expansion plans in Asia.\nTrends in Capital Expenditures and Operating Expenses",
  "Our capital expenditures and operating expenses significantly increased in 2014.  As we continue to",
  "As we continue to invest in the long term growth of Tesla,",
  "capital spending and operating expenses will continue to increase, but at a more moderate pace than",
  "moderate pace than in 2014.  During 2015, capital expenditures are",
  "expected to be about $1.5 billion as we expand production capacity, complete Model X development,",
  "X development, and invest in the Gigafactory, our stores and",
  "service centers.  We also plan to grow our Supercharger network by over 50% this year as well as",
  "year as well as continue other product development programs,",
  "including Model 3.",
  "Our operating expenses will continue to grow in 2015, but at less than half the pace of growth in",
  "pace of growth in 2014, or approximately 45% to 50%",
  "annualized.  Our R&D expenses in particular will continue to increase as we complete the",
  "as we complete the development, validation, and testing of Model X and",
  "accelerate design and engineering work on Model 3. Growth of sales, general and administrative",
  "and administrative expenses will be more modest as we will be",
  "particularly focused on increasing operational efficiency while we continue to expand our customer",
  "expand our customer and corporate infrastructure.  Over time, we expect",
  "overall operating expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue.",
  "As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 the net book value of our Supercharger network was $107.8 million",
  "was $107.8 million and $25.6 million and currently includes",
  "380 locations globally. We plan to continue investing in our Supercharger network for the",
  "network for the foreseeable future, including in North America, Europe and",
  "Asia and expect such spending to be approximately 5% of total capital spending over the next 12",
  "over the next 12 months. We allocate Supercharger related expenses to",
  "cost of revenues automotive sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses. These costs",
  "These costs were immaterial for all periods presented.",
  "Customer Financing Options",
  "We offer loans and leases in North America, Europe and Asia primarily through various financial",
  "various financial institutions.  In 2013, we began offering a resale",
  "value guarantee in connection with certain loans offered by financial institutions and have since",
  "and have since provided this guarantee to approximately 10,400 Model",
  "S customers. Model S deliveries with the resale value guarantee currently do not impact our cash",
  "not impact our cash flows and liquidity, since we receive the full amount of",
  "cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery. However, this program requires the deferral of",
  "the deferral of revenues and costs into future periods under lease",
  "accounting. Although lease accounting will continue to impact our revenues and operating results as",
  "results as this and similar programs initially ramp up, as time",
  "passes, the amortization of existing deferred revenues and costs will begin to partially offset",
  "to partially offset this adverse impact. Furthermore, while we do not assume",
  "any credit risk related to the customer, we are exposed to the risk that the vehicles\u2019 resale value",
  "resale value may be lower than our estimates and the volume of",
  "vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates which could adversely impact our gross",
  "impact our gross margin.",
  "48",
  "We currently offer leases in the U.S. directly from Tesla Finance, our captive financing entity, as",
  "entity, as well as through a bank partner.  Leasing",
  "through Tesla Finance is now available in 37 states, the District of Columbia and in 4 provinces of",
  "in 4 provinces of Canada. We leased approximately 1,150 vehicles",
  "through Tesla Finance during 2014 and about approximately 200 vehicles through our banking partner.",
  "banking partner.  Leasing through both Tesla Finance and our",
  "banking partner exposes us to residual value risk and will adversely impact our near-term revenues",
  "near-term revenues and operating results by requiring the deferral of",
  "revenues and costs into future periods under lease accounting. In addition, for leases offered",
  "for leases offered directly from Tesla Finance (but not for those offered",
  "through our bank partner), we will not receive the full amount of the cash for the vehicle price at",
  "vehicle price at delivery and will assume customer credit risk. We",
  "expect to increase our leasing activities during 2015.",
  "We have set the residual values given to our customers under our resale value guarantee program at",
  "program at what we estimate will be the trade-in value",
  "of these vehicles at the end of the term of the option.  Based on current market demand for our",
  "demand for our cars, we estimate the resale prices for our vehicles will",
  "continue to be above our resale value guarantee amounts.  Should market values or customer demand",
  "or customer demand decrease, these estimates may be impacted",
  "materially.\n \nThe Tesla Gigafactory",
  "We are developing the Tesla Gigafactory, a facility where we intend to work together with our",
  "together with our suppliers to integrate battery precursor material,",
  "cell, module and battery pack production in one location. In June 2014, we broke ground on the",
  "broke ground on the Gigafactory outside of Reno, Nevada. Construction",
  "continued during the end of 2014 at an accelerated pace with first cells expected to be produced in",
  "to be produced in 2016 for use in Model S and Model X.",
  "While our plan is to produce lithium-ion cells and finished battery packs at the Gigafactory, our",
  "Gigafactory, our plans for such production are at a very early",
  "stage. We have no experience in the production of lithium-ion cells, and accordingly we intend to",
  "we intend to engage partners with significant experience in cell",
  "production. We recently formalized our agreement with Panasonic to partner on the Gigafactory.",
  "on the Gigafactory. Panasonic will invest in production equipment that it",
  "will use to manufacture and supply us with battery cells. We will prepare and provide the land,",
  "provide the land, buildings and utilities for the Gigafactory, invest in",
  "production equipment for battery module and pack production and be responsible for the overall",
  "for the overall management of the Gigafactory. We anticipate",
  "bringing on additional partners for the Gigafactory to create a fully integrated industrial",
  "industrial complex. Although planning discussions with production and",
  "supply chain partners continue to progress well, to date we have not formalized any agreements with",
  "any agreements with any other partners. In addition, the cost of",
  "building and operating the Gigafactory could exceed our current expectations and the Gigafactory",
  "and the Gigafactory may take longer to bring online than we anticipate.",
  "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates",
  "Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles",
  "principles generally accepted in the United States. The",
  "preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and",
  "make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,",
  "liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on",
  "our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other",
  "assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting",
  "in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period",
  "to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our",
  "made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and",
  "assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these",
  "between these estimates and actual results, our future financial",
  "statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected.",
  "will be affected. We believe that the following critical accounting",
  "policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies.",
  "policies. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the",
  "most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of",
  "and results of operations.",
  "Revenue Recognition\nAutomotive Sales",
  "We recognize automotive sales revenue from sales of Model S, including vehicle options, accessories",
  "accessories and destination charges, vehicle service and",
  "sales of regulatory credits, such as ZEV and greenhouse gas emission (GHG) credits. We also",
  "credits. We also recognize automotive sales revenue from the sales of",
  "electric vehicle powertrain components and systems, such as battery packs and drive units, to other",
  "units, to other manufacturers. Revenue is recognized when",
  "(i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred and there are no",
  "and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; (iii) fees are",
  "fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection is reasonably assured.",
  "Car sales include certain standard features and customer selected options and configurations that",
  "configurations that meet the definition of a deliverable under",
  "multiple-element accounting guidance, including internet connectivity, Supercharging access, and",
  "access, and specified software updates for cars equipped with",
  "Autopilot hardware. These deliverables are valued on a stand-alone basis and we recognize their",
  "we recognize their related revenue over our performance period which is",
  "generally the eight-year life of the car or, for software upgrades, as they are delivered. If we",
  "delivered. If we sell a derivable separately, we use that pricing to",
  "determine its fair value; otherwise, we use our best estimated selling price by considering third",
  "considering third party pricing of similar options, costs used to develop",
  "and deliver the service, and other information which may be available. \n49",
  "Resale Value Guarantee",
  "We offer a resale value guarantee program to customers who purchase a Model S and finance their",
  "S and finance their vehicle through one of our commercial",
  "banking partners in the US, Canada and Europe. Under this program, Model S customers have the",
  "customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the",
  "period from 36 to 39 months after delivery for a specified value determined at time of purchase.",
  "time of purchase. Because we offer a resale value guarantee, we account",
  "for these transactions as operating leases. Accordingly, we recognize revenue attributable to the",
  "attributable to the lease on a straight-line basis over the guarantee period",
  "to automotive sales revenue. Similarly, we capitalize the cost of the leased vehicle and depreciate",
  "and depreciate its value, less expected salvage value, to cost of",
  "automotive sales over the same period.",
  "At the end of the guarantee period, which is the earlier of 39 months or the pay-off date of the",
  "pay-off date of the initial loan, the resale value guarantee and",
  "deferred revenue balances are settled to automotive sales revenue and the net book value of the",
  "book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to costs of automotive sales",
  "if our customer retains ownership of the car.  In cases where a customer returns the vehicle back",
  "the vehicle back to us between months 36 and 39, we issue a check to",
  "the customer in the amount of the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred revenue",
  "deferred revenue balance to automotive sales revenue.",
  "At least annually, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our resale value",
  "our resale value guarantee program. As we accumulate more data",
  "related to the resale values of Model S, there may be significant changes to their estimated",
  "to their estimated values.",
  "Maintenance and Service Plans",
  "We offer a prepaid maintenance program for Model S, which includes plans covering maintenance for",
  "maintenance for up to eight years or up to 100,000 miles,",
  "provided these services are purchased within a specified period of time. The maintenance plans",
  "maintenance plans cover annual inspections and the replacement of wear",
  "and tear parts, excluding tires and the battery, with either a fixed fee per visit for Tesla Ranger",
  "for Tesla Ranger service or unlimited Tesla Ranger visits for a higher",
  "initial purchase price. Payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially",
  "are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated",
  "balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales as we fulfill our performance obligations.",
  "We also offer an extended service plan, which covers the repair or replacement of Model S parts for",
  "Model S parts for an additional four years or up to an",
  "additional 50,000 miles, after the end of our initial New Vehicle Limited Warranty, provided they",
  "provided they are purchased within a specified period of time. For",

  "service plans, we offer Tesla Ranger service at a higher cost.",
  "Payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred",
  "in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and",
  "recognized in automotive sales ratably over the service coverage periods.",
  "We provided Tesla Roadster customers with the opportunity to purchase an extended warranty plan for",
  "warranty plan for the period after the end of our initial",
  "New Vehicle Limited Warranty to cover additional services for an additional three years or 36,000",
  "years or 36,000 miles. We refer to this program as our Extended",

  "before the tenth anniversary of the purchase date of their vehicles. We refer to",
  "this program as our Battery Replacement program. Amounts collected on these sales are initially",
  "sales are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated",
  "balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales as we fulfill our obligation to replace the",
  "to replace the battery packs.",
  "Inventory Valuation",
  "We value our inventories at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using standard cost,",
  "standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-",
  "out basis. We record inventory write-downs for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories",
  "inventories based upon assumptions about future demand",
  "forecasts. If our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts",
  "the excess amounts are written off.",
  "We also review inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable",
  "amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This",
  "requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to",
  "estimated cost to convert inventory on hand into a finished product.",
  "Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established and",
  "is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do",
  "not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.",
  "Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, material changes to these",
  "changes to these reserves may be required. A small change in",
  "our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\n50",
  "Warranties",
  "We provide a warranty on all vehicles, production powertrain components and systems sales, and we",
  "sales, and we accrue warranty reserves upon delivery to",
  "customer. Warranty reserves include management\u2019s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or",
  "costs to repair or to replace any items under warranty. These",
  "estimates are based on actual claims incurred to-date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and",
  "frequency and costs of future claims. We review our reserves at",
  "least quarterly to ensure that our accruals are adequate in meeting expected future warranty",
  "future warranty obligations, and we will adjust our estimates as needed.",
  "These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience may",
  "experience may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in",
  "the future. The portion of the warranty provision expected to be incurred within 12 months is",
  "within 12 months is classified as current within accrued liabilities, while the",
  "remaining amount is classified as long-term within other long-term liabilities. During the third",
  "During the third quarter of 2014, we extended the warranty on our Model",
  "S drive unit to eight years from four and reassessed our overall powertrain and vehicle warranty",
  "vehicle warranty reserves which resulted in an additional charge of",
  "approximately $14.0 million.",

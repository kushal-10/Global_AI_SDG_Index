  "Self-Driving Development and Artificial Intelligence\nWe have expertise in developing technologies, systems and software to enable self-driving vehicles using primarily vision-based technologies. Our\nFSD Computer runs our neural networks in our vehicles, and we are also developing additional computer hardware to better enable the massive amounts\nof field data captured by our vehicles to continually train and improve these neural networks for real-world performance.",
  "systems, we improve these functions in our vehicles over time through over-the-air updates.\nWe intend to establish in the future an autonomous Tesla ride-hailing network, which we expect would also allow us to access a new customer base\neven as modes of transportation evolve.\nWe are also applying our artificial intelligence learnings from self-driving technology to the field of robotics, such as through Optimus, a robotic\nhumanoid in development, which is controlled by the same AI system.\n5"

    "We will continue to expand the opportunities for our employees to add skills and develop professionally with a new Employee Educational Assistance\nProgram launching in the U.S. in the spring of 2024 to help employees pursue select certificates or degrees. With virtual, self-paced education options\navailable, employees can pursue a new path or expand their knowledge while continuing to grow their career. At Tesla, our employees show up passionate about making a difference in the world and for each other. We remain unwavering in our demand that\nour factories, offices, stores and service centers are places where our employees feel respected and appreciated. Our policies are designed to promote\nfairness and respect for everyone. We hire, evaluate and promote employees based on their skills and performance. Everyone is expected to be\ntrustworthy, demonstrate excellence in their performance and collaborate with others. With this in mind, we will not tolerate certain behaviors. These\ninclude harassment, retaliation, violence, intimidation and discrimination of any kind on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual\norientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, disability or veteran status. Anti-harassment training is conducted on day one of new hire orientation for all employees and reoccurring for leaders. In addition, we run various\nleadership development programs throughout the year aimed at enhancing leaders\u2019 skills, and in particular, helping them to understand how to\nappropriately respond to and address employee concerns. Employees are encouraged to speak up both in regard to misconduct and safety concerns and can do so by contacting the integrity line, submitting\nconcerns through our Take Charge process, or notifying their Human Resource Partner or any member of management. Concerns are reviewed in\naccordance with established protocols by investigators with expertise, who also review for trends and outcomes for remediation and appropriate controls. Responding to questions timely is key so Human Resource Partners for each functional area are visible throughout facilities and are actively involved in\ndriving culture and engagement alongside business leaders. Available Information\nWe file or furnish periodic reports and amendments thereto, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and\nCurrent Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and other information with the SEC.",
    "and abroad. While, we maintain\ninformation technology measures designed to protect us against intellectual property theft, data breaches, sabotage and other external or internal cyber-\nattacks or misappropriation, our systems and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to malware, ransomware, viruses, denial-of-service\nattacks, phishing attacks, social engineering, computer hacking, unauthorized access, exploitation of bugs, defects and vulnerabilities, breakdowns,\ndamage, interruptions, system malfunctions, power outages, terrorism, acts of vandalism, security breaches, security incidents, inadvertent or intentional\nactions by employees or other third parties, and other cyber-attacks. To the extent any security incident results in unauthorized access or damage to or acquisition, use, corruption, loss, destruction, alteration or\ndissemination of our data, including intellectual property and personal information, or our products or vehicles, or for it to be believed or reported that any\nof these occurred, it could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with applicable data breach notification laws, subject us to time\nconsuming, distracting and expensive litigation, regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness\nof database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations and contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and\nsecurity of personal information. This could result in increased costs to us and result in significant legal and financial exposure and/or reputational harm. We also rely on service providers, and similar incidents relating to their information technology systems could also have a material adverse effect on\nour business. There have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks. Our service providers, including our workforce management\nsoftware provider, have been subject to ransomware and other security incidents, and we cannot guarantee that our or our service providers\u2019 systems\nhave not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in a security incident, or other disruption\nto, our or our service providers\u2019 systems. Our ability to monitor our service providers\u2019 security measures is limited, and, in any event, malicious third\nparties may be able to circumvent those security measures. Further, the implementation, maintenance, segregation and improvement of these systems require significant management time, support and cost,\nand there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems and updating\ncurrent systems, including disruptions to the related areas of business operation. These risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory,\nprocure parts or supplies or manufacture, sell, deliver and service products, adequately protect our intellectual property or achieve and maintain\ncompliance with, or realize available benefits under, tax laws and other applicable regulations. Moreover, if we do not successfully implement, maintain or expand these systems as planned, our operations may be disrupted, our ability to\naccurately and/or timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting, which\nmay impact our ability to certify our financial results. Moreover, our proprietary information, including intellectual property and personal information,\ncould be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation may be adversely affected. If these systems or their functionality do not operate as we\nexpect them to, we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions. 21\n\nTable of Contents\nAny unauthorized control or manipulation of our products\u2019 systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our products. Our products contain complex information technology systems. For example, our vehicles and energy storage products are designed with built-in\ndata connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update their functionality. While we have implemented security\nmeasures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks, our products and their systems, malicious entities have\nreportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use such networks, products and systems to gain\ncontrol of, or to change, our products\u2019 functionality, user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our\nproducts. We encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities in the security of our products through our security vulnerability reporting policy, and we\naim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerability. However, there can be no assurance that any vulnerabilities will not be exploited before they can\nbe identified, or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful. Any unauthorized access to or control of our products or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or government investigations. In addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our products, their systems or data, as well as other factors that may result in\nthe perception that our products, their systems or data are capable of being hacked, may harm our brand, prospects and operating results. We have been\nthe subject of such reports in the past. Our business may be adversely affected by any disruptions caused by union activities. It is not uncommon for employees of certain trades at companies such as ours to belong to a union, which can result in higher employee costs and\nincreased risk of work stoppages. Moreover, regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the U.S. mandate employee participation in industrial collective\nbargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with respect to the relevant companies\u2019 operations. Although we work diligently\nto provide the best possible work environment for our employees, they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union, or we may be\nrequired to become a union signatory. From time to time, labor unions have engaged in campaigns to organize certain of our operations, as part of which\nsuch unions have filed unfair labor practice charges against us with the National Labor Relations Board (the \u201cNLRB\u201d), and they may do so in the future. Any unfavorable ultimate outcome for Tesla may have a negative impact on the perception of Tesla\u2019s treatment of our employees. Furthermore, we are\ndirectly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as suppliers and trucking and freight companies. Any work stoppages or\nstrikes organized by such unions could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and may harm our business and operating results. We may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other similar actions. As a manufacturing company, we must manage the risk of product recalls with respect to our products. Recalls for our vehicles have resulted from\nvarious hardware and software-related safety concerns or non-compliance determinations. In addition to recalls initiated by us for various causes, testing\nof or investigations into our products by government regulators or industry groups may compel us to initiate product recalls or may result in negative\npublic perceptions about the safety of our products, even if we disagree with the defect determination or have data that contradicts it. In the future, we\nmay voluntarily or involuntarily initiate recalls if any of our products are determined by us or a regulator to contain a safety defect or be noncompliant\nwith applicable laws and regulations, such as U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Such recalls, whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by\nsystems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers, could result in significant expense, supply chain complications and service\nburdens, and may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims. We provide a manufacturer\u2019s warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell directly to customers. We also provide certain warranties with\nrespect to the energy generation and storage systems we sell, including on their installation and maintenance. For components not manufactured by us,\nwe generally pass through to our customers the applicable manufacturers\u2019 warranties, but may retain some warranty responsibilities for some or all of the\nlife of such components. As part of our energy generation and storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that\nguarantee that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or other energy performance requirements specified in the\ncontract. Under these performance guarantees, we generally bear the risk of electricity production or other performance shortfalls, including in some\ncases shortfalls caused by failures in components from third party manufacturers. These risks are exacerbated in the event such manufacturers cease\noperations or fail to honor their warranties. 22\n\nTable of Contents\nIf our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products, our financial condition and operating results may be\nharmed. Warranty reserves include our management\u2019s best estimates of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty, which are based\non actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. Such estimates are inherently uncertain and\nchanges to our historical or projected experience, especially with respect to products that we have introduced relatively recently and/or that we expect to\nproduce at significantly greater volumes than our past products, may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future. Our insurance coverage strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks. We may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to losses resulting from products liability, accidents, acts of God and other claims against us,\nfor which we may have no insurance coverage. As a general matter, we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do, and in\nsome cases, we do not maintain any at all. Additionally, the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles or self-insured retentions, policy\nlimitations and exclusions, and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us. A loss\nthat is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts, which may harm our financial condition and operating results. Our debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business. The terms of certain of our debt facilities contain, and any of our other future debt agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that may limit our\nability to operate our business, including restrictions on our and/or our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things, incur additional debt or create liens. In\naddition, under certain circumstances we are required to maintain a certain amount of liquidity. As a result of these covenants, our ability to respond to\nchanges in business and economic conditions and engage in beneficial transactions, including to obtain additional financing as needed, may be restricted. Furthermore, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements, which could permit the holders to\naccelerate our obligation to repay the debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it. Additional funds may not be available to us when we need or want them. Our business and our future plans for expansion are capital-intensive, and the specific timing of cash inflows and outflows may fluctuate\nsubstantially from period to period. We may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt securities or\nthrough obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund, together with our principal sources of liquidity, the costs of developing and manufacturing our\ncurrent or future products, to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expenses or for new significant strategic investments, or to refinance our\nsignificant consolidated indebtedness, even if not required to do so by the terms of such indebtedness. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be\navailable to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our financial condition, results of\noperations, business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. We may be negatively impacted by any early obsolescence of our manufacturing equipment. We depreciate the cost of our manufacturing equipment over their expected useful lives. However, product cycles or manufacturing technology may\nchange periodically, and we may decide to update our products or manufacturing processes more quickly than expected. Moreover, improvements in\nengineering and manufacturing expertise and efficiency may result in our ability to manufacture our products using less of our currently installed\nequipment. Alternatively, as we ramp and mature the production of our products to higher levels, we may discontinue the use of already installed\nequipment in favor of different or additional equipment. The useful life of any equipment that would be retired early as a result would be shortened,\ncausing the depreciation on such equipment to be accelerated, and our results of operations may be harmed. There is no guarantee that we will have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness or that we will not incur\nadditional indebtedness. As of December 31, 2023, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $4.68 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness (see Note 11, Debt,\nto the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Our consolidated indebtedness may increase our\nvulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions. We and our subsidiaries may, subject to the limitations in the terms of our\nexisting and future indebtedness, incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt. 23\n\nTable of Contents\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due, to make payments upon conversion or\nrepurchase demands with respect to our convertible senior notes or to refinance our indebtedness as we may need or desire, depends on our future\nperformance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash\nflow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur, and to\nmake necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as\nreducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous\nor highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. In\naddition, our ability to make payments may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. We may not\nbe able to engage in these activities on desirable terms or at all, which may result in a default on our existing or future indebtedness and harm our\nfinancial condition and operating results. We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We transact business globally in multiple currencies and have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue, operating expenses\nand localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To the extent we have significant revenues denominated in such\nforeign currencies, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in U.S. dollars, as we have historically\nexperienced, and are currently experiencing. In addition, a portion of our costs and expenses have been, and we anticipate will continue to be,\ndenominated in foreign currencies. If we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the U.S. dollar depreciates\nsignificantly against these currencies, our costs as measured in U.S. dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins\nwill suffer. As a result, our operating results may be harmed. We may not be able to adequately protect or defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims, which may be\ntime-consuming and expensive, or affect the freedom to operate our business. Our competitors or other third parties may hold or obtain patents, copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary rights that could prevent, limit or\ninterfere with our ability to make, use, develop, sell or market our products and services, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business. From time to time, the holders of such intellectual property rights may assert their rights and urge us to take licenses and/or may bring suits alleging\ninfringement or misappropriation of such rights, which could result in substantial costs, negative publicity and management attention, regardless of merit. In addition, the effective protection for our brands, technologies, and proprietary information may be limited or unavailable in certain countries,\nmaking it difficult to protect our intellectual property from misappropriation or infringement. Although we make reasonable efforts to maintain the\nconfidentiality of our proprietary information, we cannot guarantee that these actions will deter or prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and confidential information could affect our competitive position. While we endeavor to obtain and protect the intellectual property rights that we expect will allow us to retain or advance our strategic initiatives in\nthese circumstances, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately identify and protect the portions of intellectual property that are\nstrategic to our business, or mitigate the risk of potential suits or other legal demands by third parties. Accordingly, we may consider the entering into\nlicensing agreements with respect to such rights, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that\nlitigation will not occur, and such licenses and associated litigation could significantly increase our operating expenses. Further, if we are determined to\nhave or believe there is a high likelihood that we have infringed upon a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may be required to cease making,\nselling or incorporating certain components or intellectual property into the goods and services we offer, to pay substantial damages and/or license\nroyalties, to redesign our products and services and/or to establish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services. In the event that we\nare required to take one or more such actions, our brand, business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed. Increased scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to the Company\u2019s ESG practices may result in\nadditional costs or risks. Companies across many industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to their environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices. Investor\nadvocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and in\nrecent years have placed increasing importance on the non-financial impacts of their investments. While our mission is to accelerate the world\u2019s transition\nto sustainable energy, if our ESG practices do not meet investor or other industry stakeholder expectations, which continue to evolve, we may incur\nadditional costs and our brand, ability to attract and retain qualified employees and business may be harmed. 24\n\nTable of Contents\nOur operations could be adversely affected by events outside of our control, such as natural disasters, wars or health epidemics. We may be impacted by natural disasters, wars, health epidemics, weather conditions, the long-term effects of climate change, power outages or\nother events outside of our control. For example, our Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Nevada are located in seismically active regions in Northern\nCalifornia and Nevada, and our Gigafactory Shanghai is located in a flood-prone area. Moreover, the area in which our Gigafactory Texas is located\nexperienced severe winter storms in the first quarter of 2021 that had a widespread impact on utilities and transportation. If major disasters such as\nearthquakes, floods or other climate-related events occur, or our information system or communication breaks down or operates improperly, our\nheadquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged, or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products. In addition,\nthe global COVID-19 pandemic has impacted economic markets, manufacturing operations, supply chains, employment and consumer behavior in nearly\nevery geographic region and industry across the world, and we have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected as a result. Also, the broader\nconsequences in the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which may include further embargoes, regional instability and geopolitical shifts;\nairspace bans relating to certain routes, or strategic decisions to alter certain routes; and potential retaliatory action by the Russian government against\ncompanies, and the extent of the conflict on our business and operating results cannot be predicted. We may incur expenses or delays relating to such\nevents outside of our control, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Risks Related to Government Laws and Regulations\nDemand for our products and services may be impacted by the status of government and economic incentives supporting the\ndevelopment and adoption of such products. Government and economic incentives that support the development and adoption of electric vehicles in the U.S. and abroad, including certain tax\nexemptions, tax credits and rebates, may be reduced, eliminated, amended or exhausted from time to time. For example, previously available incentives\nfavoring electric vehicles in certain areas have expired or were cancelled or temporarily unavailable, and in some cases were not eventually replaced or\nreinstituted, which may have negatively impacted sales. In addition, certain government and economic incentives may also be implemented or amended\nto provide benefits to manufacturers who assemble domestically, have local suppliers or have other characteristics that may not apply to Tesla. Such\ndevelopments could negatively impact demand for our vehicles, and we and our customers may have to adjust to them, including through pricing\nmodifications. In addition, certain governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy\nstorage product businesses allow us to lower our costs and encourage customers to buy our products and investors to invest in our solar financing funds. However, these incentives may expire when the allocated funding is exhausted, reduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase,\nsometimes without warning. Likewise, in jurisdictions where net metering is currently available, our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy\nthat their solar energy systems generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use. The benefit available under net metering has been\nor has been proposed to be reduced, altered or eliminated in several jurisdictions, and has also been contested and may continue to be contested before\nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Any reductions or terminations of such incentives may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and\noperating results by making our products less competitive for customers, increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our ability to attract\ninvestment partners and to form new financing funds for our solar and energy storage assets. Finally, we and our fund investors claim these U.S. federal tax credits and certain state incentives in amounts based on independently appraised fair\nmarket values of our solar and energy storage systems. Some governmental authorities have audited such values and in certain cases have determined\nthat these values should be lower, and they may do so again in the future. Such determinations may result in adverse tax consequences and/or our\nobligation to make indemnification or other payments to our funds or fund investors. We are subject to evolving laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs, legal prohibitions or unfavorable changes\nupon our operations or products. As we grow our manufacturing operations in additional regions, we are or will be subject to complex environmental, manufacturing, health and\nsafety laws and regulations at numerous jurisdictional levels in the U.S., China, Germany and other locations abroad, including laws relating to the use,\nhandling, storage, recycling, disposal and/or human exposure to hazardous materials, product material inputs and post-consumer products and with\nrespect to constructing, expanding and maintaining our facilities. New, or changes in, environmental and climate change laws, regulations or rules could\nalso lead to increased costs of compliance, including remediations of any discovered issues, and changes to our operations, which may be significant, and\nany failures to comply could result in significant expenses, delays or fines. In addition, as we have\n25\n\nTable of Contents\nincreased our employee headcount and operations, we are and may continue to be subject to increased scrutiny, including litigation and government\ninvestigations, that we will need to defend against. If we are unable to successfully defend ourselves in such litigation or government investigations, it\nmay harm our brand, ability to attract and retain qualified employees, business and financial condition. We are also subject to laws and regulations\napplicable to the supply, manufacture, import, sale, service and performance of our products both domestically and abroad. For example, in countries\noutside of the U.S., we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety, fuel economy and emissions that are often materially different from\nequivalent requirements in the U.S., thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance in all countries. This process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry, as well as compliance with\nforeign reporting and recall management systems requirements. In particular, we offer in our vehicles in certain markets Autopilot and FSD Capability features that today assist drivers with certain tedious and\npotentially dangerous aspects of road travel, but which currently require drivers to remain fully engaged in the driving operation. We are continuing to\ndevelop our Autopilot and FSD Capability technology. There are a variety of international, federal and state regulations that may apply to, and may\nadversely affect, the design and performance, sale, marketing, registration and operation of Autopilot and FSD Capability, and future capability, including\nfull self-driving vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver. This includes many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to\napply to vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver. Such regulations continue to rapidly change, which increases the likelihood of a patchwork\nof complex or conflicting regulations, or may delay, restrict or prohibit the availability of certain functionalities and vehicle designs, which could adversely\naffect our business. Finally, as a manufacturer, installer and service provider with respect to solar generation and energy storage systems, a supplier of electricity\ngenerated and stored by certain of the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers, and a provider of grid services through virtual\npower plant models, we are impacted by federal, state and local regulations and policies concerning the import or export of components, electricity\npricing, the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electrical grid and the sale of electricity generated by third party-\nowned systems. If regulations and policies are introduced that adversely impact the import or export of components, or the interconnection, maintenance\nor use of our solar and energy storage systems, they could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar and energy storage products and\nservices, threaten the economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and services in the relevant\njurisdictions, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Any failure by us to comply with a variety of U.S.",
    "We continue to expand our information technology systems as our operations grow, such as product data management, procurement, inventory\nmanagement, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management, financial, tax and regulatory compliance systems. This\nincludes the implementation of new internally developed systems and the deployment of such systems in the U.S."

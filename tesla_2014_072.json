  "If our suppliers fail to use ethical business practices and comply with applicable laws and regulations, our brand image could be\nharmed due to negative publicity. Our core values, which include developing the highest quality electric vehicles while operating with integrity, are an important component of our\nbrand image, which makes our reputation particularly sensitive to allegations of unethical business practices. We do not control our independent\nsuppliers or their business practices. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee their compliance with ethical business practices, such as environmental\nresponsibility, fair wage practices, appropriate sourcing of raw materials, and compliance with child labor laws, among others. A lack of demonstrated\ncompliance could lead us to seek alternative suppliers, which could increase our costs and result in delayed delivery of our products, product shortages\nor other disruptions of our operations. Violation of labor or other laws by our suppliers or the divergence of an independent supplier\u2019s labor or other practices from those generally\naccepted as ethical in the United States or other markets in which we do business could also attract negative publicity for us and our brand. This could\ndiminish the value of our brand image and reduce demand for our performance electric vehicles if, as a result of such violation, we were to attract\nnegative publicity.",

  "In addition, from time to\ntime, third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us in the form of letters and other forms of communication. If an\nunfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial\nposition and brand. 89\n\n \nIn November 2013, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed against Tesla in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California,\nalleging violations of, and seeking remedies pursuant to, Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The\ncomplaint, made claims against Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, sought damages and attorney\u2019s fees on the basis of allegations that, among other things,\nTesla and Mr. Musk made false and/or misleading representations and omissions, including with respect to the safety of Model S. This case was brought\non behalf of a putative class consisting of certain persons who purchased Tesla\u2019s securities between August 19, 2013 and November 17, 2013. On\nSeptember 26, 2014, the trial court, upon the motion of Tesla and Mr. Musk, dismissed the complaint with prejudice, and indicated that a formal written\norder will be forthcoming. Following the trial court\u2019s decision, Tesla and Mr. Musk brought a motion for sanctions against the plaintiffs, and that motion\nis currently pending. The plaintiffs have also appealed from the trial court\u2019s order, and that appeal is pending, as well.",
  "3\n\n \nPART I\n \nITEM  1. BUSINESS\nOverview\nWe design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, advanced electric vehicle powertrain components and\nstationary energy storage systems. We have established our own network of sales and service centers and Supercharger stations globally to accelerate\nthe widespread adoption of electric vehicles. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and business model differentiates us from\nincumbent automobile manufacturers. We are currently producing and selling our second vehicle, the Model S sedan. Model S is a four door, five-passenger premium sedan that offers\nexceptional performance, functionality and attractive styling. Model S inherited many of the electric powertrain innovations we introduced with our first\nvehicle, the Tesla Roadster. We commenced deliveries of Model S in June 2012 and as of December 31, 2014 we have delivered almost 57,000 Model S\nvehicles worldwide. Since its launch, Model S has won several awards, including the prestigious Motor Trend Car of the Year for 2013. Surveys by\nConsumer Reports gave Model S the highest customer satisfaction score of any car in the world in 2013 and gave Tesla Service the best overall\nsatisfaction rating in the entire automotive industry in 2015. Model S also earned the highest safety rating in the United States by the National Highway\nTraffic Safety Administration. We have continued to improve Model S by introducing performance, all-wheel drive dual motor, autopilot options, and\nfree over-the-air software updates. We anticipate commencing customer shipments of our third vehicle, the Model X crossover, in the third quarter of 2015. This unique vehicle has\nbeen designed to fill the niche between the roominess of a minivan and the style of an SUV, while having high performance features such as our all-\nwheel drive dual motor system and fast 0 to 60 miles per hour acceleration. After the Model X, our goal is to introduce the Model 3, a lower priced\nsedan designed for the mass market, in 2017. The commercial production of fully electric vehicles that meets consumers\u2019 range and performance expectations requires substantial design,\nengineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles.",

  "The \u201csimplified\u201d method, as permitted by the SEC, is calculated as the average of the\ntime-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. Our expected volatility is derived from our implied volatility on publicly traded options of our common stock and the historical volatilities of\nseveral unrelated public companies within industries related to our business, including the automotive OEM, automotive retail, automotive parts and\nbattery technology industries, because we have limited trading history on our common stock. When making the selections of our peer companies within\nindustries related to our business to be used in the volatility calculation, we also considered the stage of development, size and financial leverage of\npotential comparable companies.",
  "In addition, a\nnumber of potential customers may choose not to purchase our vehicles because of the lack of a more widespread service network. If we do not\nadequately address our customers\u2019 service needs, our brand and reputation will be adversely affected, which in turn, could have a material and adverse\nimpact on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. Traditional automobile manufacturers in the United States do not provide maintenance and repair services directly. Consumers must rather\nservice their vehicles through franchised dealerships or through third party maintenance service providers. We do not have any such arrangements with\nthird party service providers and it is unclear when or even whether such third party service providers will be able to acquire the expertise to service\nour vehicles. At this point, we anticipate that we will be providing substantially all of the service for our vehicles for the foreseeable future. As our\nvehicles are placed in more locations, we may encounter negative reactions from our consumers who are frustrated that they cannot use local service\nstations to the same extent as they have with their conventional automobiles and this frustration may result in negative publicity and reduced sales,\nthereby harming our business and prospects. In addition, the motor vehicle industry laws in many states require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles physically sold from\nlocations in the state. Whether these laws would also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to\nconsumers in a state in which we have no physical presence is uncertain. While we believe our Tesla Ranger program and our practice of transporting\ncustomers\u2019 vehicles to our nearest Tesla service center would satisfy regulators in these circumstances, without seeking formal regulatory guidance,\nthere are no assurances that regulators will not attempt to require that we provide physical service facilities in their states. Further, certain state\nfranchise laws which prohibit manufacturers from being licensed as a dealer or acting in the capacity of dealer also restrict manufacturers from\nproviding vehicle service. If issues arise in connection with these laws, certain aspects of Tesla\u2019s service program would need to be restructured to\ncomply with state law, which may harm our business. We may not succeed in maintaining and strengthening the Tesla brand, which would materially and adversely affect customer\nacceptance of our vehicles and components and our business, revenues and prospects. Our business and prospects are heavily dependent on our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand. Any failure to develop,\nmaintain and strengthen our brand may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell the Model S, Model X, Model 3 and other future planned\nelectric vehicles, and sell our electric powertrain components. If we do not continue to establish, maintain and strengthen our brand, we may lose the\nopportunity to build a critical mass of customers. Promoting and positioning our brand will likely depend significantly on our ability to provide high\nquality electric cars and maintenance and repair services, and we have very limited experience in these areas. Any problems associated with the Toyota\nRAV4 EV and Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV, both of which use a Tesla powertrain, or the Model X may hurt the Tesla brand. In addition, we expect that our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand will also depend heavily on the success of our\nmarketing efforts. To date, we have limited experience with marketing activities as we have relied primarily on the internet, word of mouth and\nattendance at industry trade shows to promote our brand. To further promote our brand, we may be required to change our marketing practices, which\ncould result in substantially increased advertising expenses, including the need to use traditional media such as television, radio and print. The\nautomobile industry is intensely competitive, and we may not be successful in building, maintaining and strengthening our brand. Many of our current\nand potential competitors, particularly automobile manufacturers headquartered in Detroit, Japan and the European Union, have greater name\nrecognition, broader customer relationships and substantially greater marketing resources than we do. If we do not develop and maintain a strong\nbrand, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely impacted. 28\n\n \nIf our vehicle owners customize our vehicles or change the charging infrastructure with aftermarket products, the vehicle may not\noperate properly, which could harm our business. Automobile enthusiasts may seek to \u201chack\u201d our vehicles to modify its performance which could compromise vehicle safety systems. Also, we are\naware of customers who have customized their vehicles with after-market parts that may compromise driver safety. For example, some customers have\ninstalled seats that elevate the driver such that airbag and other safety systems could be compromised. Other customers have changed wheels and tires,\nwhile others have installed large speaker systems that may impact the electrical systems of the vehicle. We have not tested, nor do we endorse, such\nchanges or products. In addition, customer use of improper external cabling or unsafe charging outlets can expose our customers to injury from high\nvoltage electricity. Such unauthorized modifications could reduce the safety of our vehicles and any injuries resulting from such modifications could\nresult in adverse publicity which would negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our plan to expand our network of Tesla stores, service centers and Superchargers will require significant cash investments and\nmanagement resources and may not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales of our electric vehicles. In addition, we\nmay not be able to open stores or service centers in certain states or Superchargers in desired locations. Our plan to expand our network of Tesla stores, service centers and Superchargers will require significant cash investments and management\nresources and may not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales of our electric vehicles. This ongoing global expansion may not have the\ndesired effect of increasing sales and expanding our brand presence to the degree we are anticipating. Furthermore, there can be no assurances that\nwe will be able to expand on the budget or timeline we have established. We will also need to ensure we are in compliance with any regulatory\nrequirements applicable to the sale and service of our vehicles in those jurisdictions, which could take considerable time and expense. If we experience\nany delays in expanding our network of Tesla stores, service centers and Superchargers, this could lead to a decrease in sales of our vehicles and could\nnegatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We have opened Tesla stores and service centers in major\nmetropolitan areas throughout North America, Europe and Asia, and we plan to open additional stores and service centers worldwide to support our\nongoing worldwide Model S rollout. We have also rapidly expanded our Supercharger network in the U.S., Europe and China. However, we may not be\nable to expand at a sufficient rate and our planned expansion will require significant cash investment and management resources, as well as efficiency\nin the execution of establishing these locations and in hiring and training the necessary employees to effectively sell and service our vehicles. Furthermore, certain states and foreign jurisdictions may have permit requirements, franchise dealer laws or similar laws or regulations that\nmay preclude or restrict our ability to open stores or sell vehicles out of such states and jurisdictions. Any such prohibition or restriction may lead to\ndecreased sales in such jurisdictions, which could harm our business, prospects and operating results. See Risk Factor \u201cWe may face regulatory\nlimitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly or over the internet which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric\nvehicles.\u201d Additionally, we may face potential difficulties in finding suitable Supercharger sites in desired locations, negotiating leases or obtaining\nrequired permits for such locations. We face risks associated with our international operations and expansion, including unfavorable regulatory, political, tax and labor\nconditions and establishing ourselves in new markets, all of which could harm our business. We face various risks associated with our international operations and expansion. We currently have international operations and subsidiaries in\nvarious countries and jurisdictions in Europe and Asia that are subject to the legal, political, regulatory and social requirements and economic\nconditions in these jurisdictions. Additionally, as part of our growth strategy, we will continue to expand our sales, maintenance, repair and\nSupercharger services internationally, particularly in China. However, we have limited experience to date selling and servicing our vehicles\ninternationally, as well as limited experience installing and operating Superchargers internationally, and international expansion requires us to make\nsignificant expenditures, including the establishment of local operating entities, hiring of local employees and establishing facilities in advance of\ngenerating any revenue. We are subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs, impact our\nability to sell our electric vehicles and require significant management attention. These risks include:\n\u25cf\nconforming our vehicles to various international regulatory and safety requirements where our vehicles are sold, or homologation;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty in establishing, staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties attracting customers in new jurisdictions;\n\u25cf\nforeign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements, including foreign taxes that we may not be able to offset against taxes\nimposed upon us in the United States, and foreign tax and other laws limiting our ability to repatriate funds to the United States;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including risks related to any interest rate swap or other hedging\nactivities we undertake;\n29\n\n \n\u25cf\nour ability to enforce our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect\nintellectual property rights to the same extent as do the United States, Japan and European countries, which increases the risk of\nunauthorized, and uncompensated, use of our technology;\n\u25cf\nUnited States and foreign government trade restrictions, customs regulations, tariffs and price or exchange controls;\n\u25cf\nforeign labor laws, regulations and restrictions;\n\u25cf\npreferences of foreign nations for domestically produced vehicles;\n\u25cf\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships;\n\u25cf\npolitical instability, natural disasters, war or events of terrorism; and\n\u25cf\nthe strength of international economies. Additionally, as we have expanded into new international markets, we have faced challenges with ensuring that our charging equipment works\nsuccessfully with the charging infrastructure in such markets. For example, we have encountered such challenges in Norway and China. If customers\nexperience problems with the way our charging equipment works with the local charging infrastructure, or we are unable to adapt our equipment to\nresolve such problems, then the viability and acceptance of our vehicles in such markets could be materially and adversely affected. If we fail to successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed. Developments in alternative technologies or improvements in the internal combustion engine may materially adversely affect the\ndemand for our electric vehicles. Significant developments in alternative technologies, such as advanced diesel, ethanol, hydrogen, fuel cells or compressed natural gas, or\nimprovements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine, may materially and adversely affect our business and prospects in ways we do not\ncurrently anticipate. Any failure by us to develop new or enhanced technologies or processes, or to react to changes in existing technologies, could\nmaterially delay our development and introduction of new and enhanced electric vehicles, which could result in the loss of competitiveness of our\nvehicles, decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors. The unavailability, reduction or elimination of, or uncertainty regarding, government and economic incentives in the U.S. and abroad\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. Any reduction or elimination of government and economic incentives due to policy changes the reduced need for such incentives as the customer\nbase of our electric vehicles expands, fiscal tightening or other reasons may result in the diminished competitiveness of the alternative fuel vehicle\nindustry generally or our electric vehicles in particular. Such reduction or elimination of incentives could materially and adversely affect our growth as\nwell because our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results, as our growth depends, in part, on the availability and amounts of\ngovernment incentives. For example, we currently benefit from certain exemptions in the United States, such as the California state sales and use taxes. Similarly, government programs in Europe favor the purchase of electric vehicles, including through disincentives that discourage the use of gas-\npowered vehicles. In Norway, for example, the purchase of electric vehicles is not currently subject to import taxes, taxes on non-recurring vehicle fees,\nthe 25% value added tax or the purchase taxes that apply to the purchase of gas-powered vehicles. If such government programs are reduced or\neliminated, or the available benefits thereunder are exhausted earlier than anticipated, sales of all electric vehicles, including our Model S, could be\nadversely affected. In addition, customers in certain markets may delay taking delivery of their Tesla vehicles if they believe that certain electric vehicle\nincentives will be available at a later date, which may negatively affect our ability to achieve our planned delivery targets. Our strategic relationships with third parties, such as Panasonic, are subject to various risks which could adversely affect our\nbusiness and future prospects. Our strategic relationships third parties, such as Panasonic which supplies us with battery cells for use in Model S and Model X and is our\npartner in the Gigafactory, pose various risks to us, including potential loss of access to important technology and vehicle parts, potential loss of\nbusiness and adverse publicity. In addition, these third parties may not perform as expected under our agreements with them, such as with respect to\nvehicle parts quality of timeliness, and we may have disagreements or disputes with these third parties.",
  "We may not be able to successfully develop new electric vehicles, address new market segments or develop a significantly broader customer\nbase. In 2012, we publicly revealed an early prototype of the Model X crossover as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the Model S\nplatform and are currently testing our Beta Model X vehicles. We have also announced our intent to develop Model 3 based on a smaller platform than\nthe Model S which we expect to produce at the Tesla Factory after the introduction of Model X. Model 3 is currently planned to be a lower cost, smaller\nsedan designed for the mass market. Therefore, we intend to manufacture Model 3 in significantly higher volumes than Model S and there can be no\nassurance we can successfully scale our business accordingly. In addition, we have not yet finalized the design, engineering or component sourcing\nplans for Model 3 and there are no assurances that we will be able to bring this vehicle to market at the price point and in the volume that we currently\nintend, if at all. The market for vehicles in the price range we expect for Model 3 is much more competitive than for Model S and Model X, and therefore\nmargins are likely to be lower compared to Model S and Model X margins. Our efforts to manufacture and sell a sufficiently profitable Model 3 may not\nbe as successful, and therefore our business, prospects and operating results may suffer. Our failure to address additional market opportunities would\nharm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. The automotive market is highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in this industry. We currently face\ncompetition from new and established competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future. The worldwide automotive market, particularly for alternative fuel vehicles, is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more\nso in the future. Other automobile manufacturers entered the electric vehicle market at the end of 2010 and we expect additional competitors to enter\nthis market. With respect to Model S, we face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive premium\nsedan market, including Audi, BMW, Lexus and Mercedes. Many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market. BMW,\nDaimler, Nissan, Fiat, Ford and Mitsubishi, among others, have electric vehicles available today. Moreover, Porsche, Lexus, Audi, Volkswagen and Volvo\nare also developing electric vehicles. In addition, several manufacturers, including General Motors, Toyota, Ford, and Honda, are each selling hybrid\nvehicles, and certain of these manufacturers have announced plug-in versions of their hybrid vehicles. For example, in December 2010, General Motors\nintroduced the Chevrolet Volt, which is a plug-in hybrid vehicle that operates purely on electric power for a limited number of miles, at which time an\ninternal combustion engine engages to recharge the battery pack. Moreover, it has been reported that many of the other large OEMs, such as Daimler, Lexus and Audi, are also developing electric vehicles. Several new start-ups have also entered or announced plans to enter the market for performance electric vehicles. Finally, electric vehicles have\nalready been brought to market in China and other foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the United States market\nas well. Most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than\nwe do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their\nproducts. Virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do. In addition,\nalmost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do. Our competitors may be in a stronger position\nto respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design, develop, market and sell their products more effectively. Additionally, we have not in\nthe past, and do not currently, offer customary discounts on our vehicles like most of our competitors do. We expect competition in our industry to intensify in the future in light of increased demand for alternative fuel vehicles, continuing globalization\nand consolidation in the worldwide automotive industry. Factors affecting competition include product quality and features, innovation and development\ntime, pricing, reliability, safety, fuel economy, customer service and financing terms. Increased competition may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and\nincreased inventory, which may result in a further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and\nprospects. Our ability to successfully compete in our industry will be fundamental to our future success in existing and new markets and our market\nshare. There can be no assurances that we will be able to compete successfully in our markets. If our competitors introduce new cars or services that\ncompete with or surpass the quality, price or performance of our cars or services, we may be unable to satisfy existing customers or attract new\ncustomers at the prices and levels that would allow us to generate attractive rates of return on our investment. Increased competition could result in\nprice reductions and revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and\noperating results. 26\n\n \nDemand in the automobile industry is volatile, which may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and adversely affect our operating results. Volatility of demand in the automobile industry may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial\ncondition. The markets in which we currently compete and plan to compete in the future have been subject to considerable volatility in demand in\nrecent periods. Demand for automobile sales depends to a large extent on general, economic, political and social conditions in a given market and the\nintroduction of new vehicles and technologies. As a low volume producer, we have less financial resources than more established automobile\nmanufacturers to withstand changes in the market and disruptions in demand. As our business grows, economic conditions and trends in other\ncountries and regions where we currently or will sell our electric vehicles, such as Europe and Asia, will impact our business, prospects and operating\nresults as well. Demand for our electric vehicles may also be affected by factors directly impacting automobile price or the cost of purchasing and\noperating automobiles, such as sales and financing incentives, prices of raw materials and parts and components, cost of fuel and governmental\nregulations, including tariffs, import regulation and other taxes. Volatility in demand may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory,\nwhich may result in further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. These\neffects may have a more pronounced impact on our business given our relatively smaller scale and financial resources as compared to many incumbent\nautomobile manufacturers. If we are unable to establish and maintain confidence in our long-term business prospects among consumers, analysts and within our\nindustry, then our financial condition, operating results, business prospects and stock price may suffer materially. Our vehicles are highly technical products that require maintenance and support. If we were to cease or cut back operations, even years from\nnow, buyers of our vehicles from years earlier might have much more difficulty in maintaining their vehicles and obtaining satisfactory support. As a\nresult, consumers may be less likely to purchase our vehicles now if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our operations will\ncontinue for many years. Similarly, suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships\nwith us if they are not convinced that our business will succeed. If we are required to curtail our expansion plans in the future as we have done in the\npast, this may result in negative perceptions regarding our long-term business prospects and may lead to cancellations of Model S or Model X orders\nand reservations. Accordingly, in order to build and maintain our business, we must maintain confidence among customers, suppliers, analysts and other parties in\nour liquidity and long-term business prospects. In contrast to some more established automakers, we believe that, in our case, the task of maintaining\nsuch confidence may be particularly complicated by factors such as the following:\n\u25cf\nour limited operating history;\n\u25cf\nunfamiliarity with or uncertainty about Model X and future Tesla vehicles;\n\u25cf\nuncertainty about the long-term marketplace acceptance of alternative fuel vehicles generally, or electric vehicles specifically;\n\u25cf\nthe perceived prospect that we will need ongoing infusions of external capital to fund our planned operations;\n\u25cf\nthe size of our expansion plans in comparison to our existing capital base and scope and history of operations; and\n\u25cf\nthe prospect or actual emergence of direct, sustained competitive pressure from more established automakers, which may be more likely\nif our initial efforts are perceived to be commercially successful. Many of these factors are largely outside our control, and any negative perceptions about our long-term business prospects, even if exaggerated\nor unfounded, would likely harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds when needed. We have limited experience servicing our vehicles, especially in certain regions outside of the United States, and we are using a\ndifferent service model from the one typically used in the industry. If we are unable to address the service requirements of our\nexisting and future customers, our business will be materially and adversely affected. If we are unable to successfully address the service requirements of our existing and future customers and meet customer expectations\nregarding service, our business and prospects will be materially and adversely affected. We have limited experience servicing our vehicles, especially in\nEurope and Asia. Servicing electric vehicles is different than servicing vehicles with internal combustion engines and requires specialized skills,\nincluding high voltage training and servicing techniques. If we are unable to satisfactorily service our customers and the various service related issues\nthat they are facing and may face in the future, our ability to generate customer loyalty, grow our business and sell additional vehicles could be\nimpaired. 27\n\n \nWe service our performance electric vehicles through our company-owned Tesla service centers, certain of our stores, and through our mobile\nservice technicians known as the Tesla Rangers. However, certain service centers have been open for short periods, such as those outside of the United\nStates, and to date we have only limited experience servicing our performance vehicles at these locations. We will need to open new standalone service\ncenters in locations around the world and hire and train significant numbers of new employees to staff these service centers and act as Tesla Rangers in\norder to successfully maintain our fleet of delivered performance electric vehicles. We only implemented our Tesla Rangers program in October 2009\nand have limited experience in deploying them to service our customers\u2019 vehicles. There can be no assurance that these service arrangements or our\nlimited experience servicing our vehicles will adequately address the service requirements of our customers to their satisfaction, or that we will have\nsufficient resources to meet these service requirements in a timely manner as the volume of vehicles we are able to deliver annually increases. We do not expect to be able to open Tesla service centers in all the geographic areas in which our existing and potential customers may reside. In order to address the service needs of customers who are not in geographical proximity to our service centers, we plan to either transport those\nvehicles to the nearest Tesla store or service center for servicing or deploy our mobile Tesla Rangers to service the vehicles at the customer\u2019s location. These special arrangements may be expensive and we may not be able to recoup the costs of providing these services to our customers.",
  "If we cannot raise\nadditional funds when we need or want them, our operations and prospects could be negatively affected. The design, manufacture, sale and servicing of automobiles is a capital intensive business. We expect that our principal sources of liquidity will\nprovide us adequate liquidity based on our current plans. However, until we are consistently generating positive free cash flows, if the costs for\ndeveloping and manufacturing Model X exceed our expectations or if we incur any significant unplanned expenses or embark on or accelerate new\nsignificant strategic investments, such as the Gigafactory, we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt\nsecurities or through obtaining credit from government or financial institutions. This capital will be necessary to fund our ongoing operations, continue\nresearch and development projects, including those for our planned Model X crossover and Model 3 vehicle, establish sales and service centers, build\nand deploy Superchargers and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce Model X. We cannot be certain that\nadditional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our financial\ncondition, results of operations, business and prospects could be materially adversely affected. If we fail to effectively manage the residual, financing and credit risks for our recently launched Model S leasing program, our\nbusiness may suffer. We recently introduced a leasing program in the United States and Canada through our captive finance company, Tesla Finance. The profitability\nof the leasing program depends on our ability to accurately project residual values, secure adequate financing and/or business partners to fund and\ngrow this program, and manage customer credit risk. If actual residual values of Model S vehicles are below our estimates, we may suffer lower\nprofitability or potentially have losses. If we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program with either internal funds or external financing sources,\nwe may be unable to grow our sales. Additionally, if we do not properly screen customers for ability to pay their leases on time, we may be exposed to\nexcessive credit risks and associated losses. Furthermore, if our leasing business grows substantially, our business may suffer if we cannot effectively\nmanage the greater levels of residual and credit risks resulting from growth. Finally, if we do not successfully monitor and comply with federal and state\nfinancial regulations and consumer protection laws governing lease transactions, we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties, either of\nwhich may harm our business. Any failure to execute on the Daimler B-Class EV program could hurt our reputation as well as our profitability on this program. We have worked with Daimler to develop a full electric powertrain for a Daimler Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV vehicle. We have substantially\ncompleted our development services under this B-Class program and commenced production of electric powertrains and battery packs for Daimler. The\nsupply agreement for these products contemplates customary obligations of us such as timely deliveries, warranty and product defect obligations. If we\nfail to meet these obligations, or if we exceed our current cost projections for producing these products, our profitability on this program will suffer and\nthis could have a negative impact on our operating results. We may face regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly or over the internet which could materially and adversely\naffect our ability to sell our electric vehicles. We sell our vehicles from our Tesla stores as well as over the internet. We may not be able to sell our vehicles through this sales model in each\nstate in the United States as many states have laws that may be interpreted to prohibit internet sales by manufacturers to residents of the state or to\nimpose other limitations on this sales model, including laws that prohibit manufacturers from selling vehicles directly to consumers without the use of\nan independent dealership or without a physical presence in the state. In certain states in which we are not able to obtain dealer licenses, we have\nworked with state regulators to open galleries, which are locations where potential customers can view our vehicles but are not full retail locations. It is\npossible that a state regulator could later determine that the activities at our gallery constitute unlicensed sales of motor vehicles. In many states, the application of state motor vehicle laws to our specific sales model is largely untested under state motor vehicle industry laws\nand is being determined by a fact specific analysis of numerous factors, including whether we have a physical presence or employees in the applicable\nstate, whether we advertise or conduct other activities in the applicable state, how the sale transaction is structured, the volume of sales into the state,\nand whether the state in question prohibits manufacturers from acting as dealers. As a result of the fact specific and largely untested nature of these\nissues, and the fact that applying these laws intended for the traditional automobile distribution model to our sales model allows for some interpretation\nand discretion by the regulators, the manner in which the applicable authorities are applying their state laws to our distribution model continues to be\ndifficult to predict. Laws in some states have limited our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators and may continue to do so. 36\n\n \nIn addition, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles may be subject to challenges as to whether such decisions comply with\napplicable state motor vehicle industry laws. For example, vehicle dealer associations in New York, Ohio and Massachusetts have filed lawsuits to\nrevoke dealer licenses issued to us. These lawsuits have been dismissed, and in one recent court decision, the Supreme Court of Massachusetts held\nthat state franchise laws like the one in Massachusetts do not restrict a manufacturer, like Tesla, that does not use franchised dealers from selling its\nvehicles directly to consumers. Such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state laws were not designed to prevent our distribution model. Similar lawsuits have been filed in Georgia and Missouri. Possible additional challenges in other states, if successful, could restrict or prohibit our\nability to sell our vehicles to residents in such states. In some states, there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by vehicle dealer\nassociations to propose bills and regulations that, if enacted, would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales\nmodel. Such events recently occurred in New Jersey, where the Motor Vehicle Commission, at the behest of the local automobile dealer lobby, passed a\nnew regulation which purported to invalidate our sales licenses in the state, and in Michigan, where the state\u2019s automobile dealer association managed\nto add language into an unrelated bill that had the effect of impairing our right to sell vehicles through Tesla stores in Michigan. We have brought a\nlawsuit in New Jersey to invalidate that regulation, which we believe to be unlawful, and we are evaluating legislative and litigation solutions to remedy\nthe situation in Michigan. Other states, such as New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania, have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate, but at the\nsame time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate. We are also registered as both a motor vehicle manufacturer and dealer in Canada, Australia, and Japan, and have obtained licenses to sell\nvehicles in other places such as Hong Kong and China. Furthermore, while we have performed an analysis of the principal laws in the European Union\nrelating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws, we have not performed a complete analysis in all foreign jurisdictions in which\nwe may sell vehicles. Accordingly, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered\nthat may restrict our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to\ninterpret and may change over time. We may need to defend ourselves against patent or trademark infringement claims, which may be time-consuming and would cause us\nto incur substantial costs. Companies, organizations or individuals, including our competitors, may hold or obtain patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights that\nwould prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, develop, sell or market our vehicles or components, which could make it more difficult for\nus to operate our business. From time to time, we may receive communications from holders of patents or trademarks regarding their proprietary\nrights. Companies holding patents or other intellectual property rights may bring suits alleging infringement of such rights or otherwise assert their\nrights and urge us to take licenses. In addition, if we are determined to have infringed upon a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may be\nrequired to do one or more of the following:\n\u25cf\ncease selling, incorporating or using vehicles or offering goods or services that incorporate or use the challenged intellectual property;\n\u25cf\npay substantial damages;\n\u25cf\nobtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at\nall;\n\u25cf\nredesign our vehicles or other goods or services; or\n\u25cf\nestablish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to obtain a license to the infringed technology or other\nintellectual property right, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, any\nlitigation or claims, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. We may also face claims that our use of technology licensed or otherwise obtained from a third party infringes the rights of others. In such cases,\nwe may seek indemnification from our licensors/suppliers under our contracts with them. However, indemnification may be unavailable or insufficient to\ncover our costs and losses, depending on our use of the technology, whether we choose to retain control over conduct of the litigation, and other\nfactors. 37\n\n \nOur patent applications may not result in issued patents, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to prevent others\nfrom interfering with our commercialization of our products. The status of patents involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth and effectiveness of patented claims is uncertain. We cannot\nbe certain that we are the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or the first to file patent applications on these inventions,\nnor can we be certain that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents or that any of our issued patents will afford sufficient protection\nagainst someone creating a knockoff of our products, or as a defense against a competitor who claims that we are infringing its patents. In addition,\npatent applications filed in foreign countries are subject to laws, rules and procedures that differ from those of the United States, and thus we cannot be\ncertain that foreign patent applications related to issued U.S. patents will result in issued patents in those foreign jurisdictions. In addition, others may\nobtain patents that we need to license or design around, either of which would increase costs and may adversely affect our business, prospects,\nfinancial condition and operating results. Our trademark applications in certain countries remain subject to outstanding opposition proceedings. We currently sell and market our products and services in various countries under our Tesla marks. We have filed trademark applications for our\nTesla marks and opposition proceedings to trademark applications of third parties in various countries in which we currently sell and plan to sell our\nproducts and services. Certain of our trademark applications are subject to outstanding opposition proceedings brought by owners or applicants\nalleging prior applications for or use of similar marks. If we cannot resolve these oppositions and thereby secure registered rights in these countries,\nour ability to challenge third party users of the Tesla marks will be reduced and the value of the marks representing our exclusive brand name in these\ncountries will be diluted. In addition, there is a risk that the prior rights owners could in the future take actions to challenge our use of the Tesla marks\nin these countries. Such actions could have a severe impact on our position in these countries and may inhibit our ability to use the Tesla marks in these\ncountries. If we were prevented from using the Tesla marks in any or all of these countries, we would need to expend significant additional financial and\nmarketing resources on establishing an alternative brand identity in these markets. Our facilities or operations could be damaged or adversely affected as a result of disasters or unpredictable events. Our corporate headquarters in Palo Alto, Tesla Factory in Fremont and additional component manufacturing facilities in Lathrop are located in\nNorthern California, a region known for seismic activity. If major disasters such as earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, wars, terrorist attacks,\ncomputer viruses, pandemics or other events occur, or our information system or communications network breaks down or operates improperly, our\nheadquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged, or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products. In addition,\nour lease for our Palo Alto facility permits the landlord to terminate the lease following a casualty event if the needed repairs are in excess of certain\nthresholds and we do not agree to pay for any uninsured amounts. We may incur expenses relating to such damages, which could have a material\nadverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.",
  "We believe our vehicles deliver unparalleled driving experiences with\ninstantaneous and sustained acceleration through an extended range of speed. In addition, our Model S seats five adults, provides best in\nclass storage in the trunk and hood while offering design and performance comparable to, or better than, other premium sedans. We sell our vehicles through our own sales and service network which we are continuing to grow globally.",
  "As we open additional Tesla stores and service centers, we secure dealer licenses (or\ntheir equivalent) and engage in sales activities to sell our vehicles directly to consumers. A few states, such as Texas and Michigan, do not permit\nautomobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer, or otherwise restrict a manufacturer\u2019s ability to deliver or\nservice vehicles. To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer, we must generally conduct the sale out of the state via the\ninternet, phone or mail. In such states, we have opened \u201cgalleries\u201d that serve an educational purpose and are not retail locations. As we expand our retail footprint in the United States, some automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our\noperations in court and used administrative and legislative processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to\nnew locations. Although we have thus far prevailed in every lawsuit brought by dealer associations, we expect that the dealer associations will continue\nto mount challenges to our business model. In addition, we expect the dealer associations to actively lobbying state Governors and legislators to\ninterpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to Tesla\u2019s ownership and operation of its own retail and service locations. While we have analyzed the principal laws in the US, EU, China, Japan, UK, and Australia relating to our distribution model and believe we\ncomply with such laws, we have not performed a complete analysis of all jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles. Accordingly, there may be laws in\ncertain jurisdictions that may restrict our sales and service operations. Competition\nThe worldwide automotive market, particularly for alternative fuel vehicles, is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more\nso in the future as we introduce additional, lower priced vehicles such as our Model 3. We believe the impact of new regulatory requirements for\noccupant safety and vehicle emissions, technological advances in powertrain and consumer electronics components, and shifting customer needs and\nexpectations are causing the industry to evolve in the direction of electric-based vehicles. We believe the primary competitive factors in our markets\ninclude but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\ntechnological innovation;\n\u25cf\nproduct quality and safety;\n\u25cf\nservice options;\n\u25cf\nproduct performance;\n\u25cf\ndesign and styling;\n\u25cf\nbrand perception;\n\u25cf\nproduct price; and\n\u25cf\nmanufacturing efficiency. We believe that our vehicles compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification as well as based on their propulsion\ntechnology. For example, Model S competes primarily in the extremely competitive premium sedan market with internal combustion vehicles from more\nestablished automobile manufacturers, including Audi, BMW, Lexus and Mercedes. Our vehicles also compete with vehicles propelled by alternative\nfuels, principally electricity. 14\n\n \nMany established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market. BMW,\nDaimler, Nissan, Fiat, Ford and Mitsubishi, among others, have electric vehicles available today. Moreover, Porsche, Lexus, Audi, Volkswagen and Volvo\nare also developing electric vehicles. Electric vehicles have also already been brought to market in China and other foreign countries and we expect a\nnumber of those manufacturers to enter the United States market as well. In addition, several manufacturers, including General Motors, Toyota, Ford,\nand Honda, are each selling hybrid vehicles, and certain of these manufacturers have announced plug-in versions of their hybrid vehicles. Most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, may be able to devote greater resources to the\nmanufacture, sale and support of their products, and have other advantages. We believe our exclusive focus on electric vehicles and electric vehicle\ncomponents, as well as our history of vehicle development and production, however, are the basis on which we can compete in the global automotive\nmarket in spite of the challenges posed by our competition. Intellectual Property\nAs part of our business, we seek to protect our intellectual property rights in various ways, including through trademarks, copyrights, trade\nsecrets, including know-how, patents, patent applications, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, intellectual property licenses and other\ncontractual rights. Additionally, consistent with our mission to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport, we announced a patent policy in which we\nirrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related\nequipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith. We made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common, rapidly-evolving\nplatform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting ourselves, other companies making electric vehicles, and the world. Segment Information\nWe have determined that we operate as one reportable segment, which is the design, development, manufacturing and sales of electric vehicles\nand electric powertrain components. For information regarding financial data by geographic areas, see Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Item 8.",
  "We believe the benefits we receive\nfrom distribution ownership will enable us to improve the speed of product development and improve the capital efficiency of our business. We are also\ncontinuing to build our network of Superchargers in the United States, Europe and Asia to provide properly equipped Model S vehicle owners as well as\nfuture Tesla vehicle owners with fast and free charging to enable convenient long distance travel. In addition to developing our own vehicles, we have developed and currently sell and service full electric powertrain systems and components to\nother automobile manufacturers.",
  "Also, projections of any evaluation\nof effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.",
  "The occurrence of any of the foregoing could\nadversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. 30\n\n \nThe operation of our vehicles is different from internal combustion engine vehicles and our customers may experience difficulty\noperating them properly, including difficulty transitioning between different methods of braking. We have designed our vehicles to minimize inconvenience and inadvertent driver damage to the powertrain. In certain instances, these\nprotections may cause the vehicle to behave in ways that are unfamiliar to drivers of internal combustion vehicles. For example, we employ\nregenerative braking to recharge the battery pack in most modes of vehicle operation. Our customers may become accustomed to using this\nregenerative braking instead of the wheel brakes to slow the vehicle. However, when the vehicle is at maximum charge, the regenerative braking is not\nneeded and is not employed by the vehicle. Accordingly, our customers may have difficulty shifting between different methods of braking. In addition,\nwe use safety mechanisms to limit motor torque when the powertrain system reaches elevated temperatures. In such instances, the vehicle\u2019s\nacceleration and speed will decrease. Finally, if the driver permits the battery pack to substantially deplete its charge, the vehicle will progressively\nlimit motor torque and speed to preserve the charge that remains. The vehicle will lose speed and ultimately coast to a stop. Despite several warnings\nabout an imminent loss of charge, the ultimate loss of speed may be unexpected. There can be no assurance that our customers will operate the vehicles properly, especially in these situations. Any accidents resulting from such\nfailure to operate our vehicles properly could harm our brand and reputation, result in adverse publicity and product liability claims, and have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. In addition, if consumers dislike these features, they may\nchoose not to buy additional cars from us, which could also harm our business and prospects. If we are unable to keep up with advances in electric vehicle technology, we may suffer a decline in our competitive position. We may be unable to keep up with changes in electric vehicle technology and, as a result, may suffer a decline in our competitive position. Any\nfailure to keep up with advances in electric vehicle technology would result in a decline in our competitive position which would materially and\nadversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. Our research and development efforts may not be sufficient to adapt\nto changes in electric vehicle technology. As technologies change, we plan to upgrade or adapt our vehicles and introduce new models in order to\ncontinue to provide vehicles with the latest technology, in particular battery cell technology. However, our vehicles may not compete effectively with\nalternative vehicles if we are not able to source and integrate the latest technology into our vehicles. For example, we do not currently manufacture\nbattery cells, which makes us dependent upon other suppliers of battery cell technology for our battery packs. If we are unable to attract and/or retain key employees and hire qualified management, technical, vehicle engineering and\nmanufacturing personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed and our stock price may decline. The loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations, delay the development and introduction of our vehicles and\nservices, and negatively impact our business, prospects and operating results as well as cause our stock price to decline. In particular, we are highly\ndependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, Product Architect and Chairman of our Board of Directors, and JB Straubel, our\nChief Technical Officer. None of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term. There can be no assurance that we will\nbe able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business. Our future success depends upon our ability to attract and\nretain our executive officers and other key technology, sales, marketing, engineering, manufacturing and support personnel and any failure to do so\ncould adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We have in the past and may in the future experience\ndifficulty in retaining members of our senior management team as well as technical, vehicle engineering and manufacturing personnel due to various\nfactors, such as a very competitive labor market for talented individuals with automotive experience. In addition, we do not have \u201ckey person\u201d life\ninsurance policies covering any of our officers or other key employees. Currently in Northern California, there is increasing competition for talented individuals with the specialized knowledge of electric vehicles,\nsoftware engineers, manufacturing engineers and other skilled employees and this competition affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire\nnew ones. Our continued success depends upon our continued ability to hire new employees in a timely manner and retain current employees. Additionally, we compete with many mature and prosperous companies in Northern California that have far greater financial resources than we do and\nthus can offer current or perspective employees more lucrative incentive packages than we can. Any difficulties in retaining current employees or\nrecruiting new ones would have an adverse effect on our performance. We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer. We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, Product Architect, Chairman of our Board of Directors and\nlargest stockholder. Although Mr. Musk spends significant time with Tesla and is highly active in our management, he does not devote his full time and\nattention to Tesla. Mr. Musk also currently serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technical Officer of Space Exploration Technologies, a developer\nand manufacturer of space launch vehicles, and Chairman of SolarCity, a solar equipment installation company. 31\n\n \nWe are subject to various environmental and safety laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and negatively\nimpact our ability to operate our manufacturing facilities.",
  "Our design and vehicle engineering capabilities, combined with the technical\nadvancements of our powertrain system, have enabled us to design and develop electric vehicles that we believe overcome the design, styling, and\nperformance issues that have historically limited broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles. As a result, we believe our customers enjoy several\nbenefits, including:\n\u00b7\nLong Range and Recharging Flexibility. Our vehicles offer ranges that are over double the range of any other commercially available\nelectric vehicle. In addition, our vehicles incorporate our proprietary on-board charging system, permitting recharging from almost any\navailable electrical outlet. Model S also offers fast charging capability from our Supercharger network. We believe the long-range and\ncharging flexibility of our vehicles will help reduce consumer anxiety over range, alleviate the need for expensive, large-scale charging\ninfrastructure, and differentiate our vehicles as compared to those of our competitors. \u00b7\nEnergy Efficiency and Cost of Ownership. We believe our vehicles offer consumers an attractive cost of ownership when compared to\nsimilar internal combustion engine or hybrid electric vehicles. Using only an electric powertrain enables us to create a lighter, more\nenergy efficient vehicle that is mechanically simpler than currently available hybrid or internal combustion engine vehicles. We currently\nestimate that the cost to fuel our vehicles is approximately one-fourth that of comparable internal combustion vehicles in the United\nStates, and even less internationally where gasoline prices are typically higher. We also expect our electric vehicles will have lower\nrelative maintenance costs than hybrid, plug-in hybrid, or internal combustion engine vehicles due to fewer moving parts and the absence\nof certain components, including oil, oil filters, spark plugs and engine valves. Additionally, government incentives that are currently\navailable can reduce the cost of ownership even further. \u00b7\nHigh-Performance Without Compromised Design or Functionality.",
  "Such concerns could affect use of\nelectronic systems in Model S, such as the 17 inch display screen, which could reduce the appeal of Model S or require adjustments to the display\nscreen\u2019s functionality. As we are currently delivering vehicles in Europe and Asia, we are subject to laws and regulations applicable to the import, sale and service of\nautomobiles in those regions. For example, we are required to meet vehicle-specific safety standards that are often materially different from U.S. requirements, thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance. Unlike in the U.S. where we self-\ncertify our vehicles\u2019 compliance with standards, we must obtain advanced approval from regulatory agencies regarding the proper certification or\nhomologation of our vehicles to enter into these markets. This process necessitates that foreign regulatory officials review and certify our vehicles prior\nto market entry. In addition, we must comply with regulations applicable to vehicles after they enter the market, including foreign reporting\nrequirements and recall management systems. To the extent U.S. or international laws change, some or all of our vehicles may not comply with any new applicable international, federal, state\nor local laws, which would have an adverse effect on our business. Compliance with changing regulations could be burdensome, time consuming, and\nexpensive. To the extent compliance with new regulations is cost prohibitive, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be\nadversely affected. 33\n\n \nWe retain certain personal information about our customers and may be subject to various privacy and consumer protection laws. Our collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information of our customers is subject to federal, state, and international laws. These laws continue to be enacted and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with changing international laws may cause us\nto incur substantial costs, expose us to legal liability or require us to change our business practices. Our privacy policy is posted on our website, and\nany failure by us or our vendor or other business partners to comply with it or with federal, state or international privacy, data protection or security\nlaws or regulations could result in regulatory or litigation-related actions against us, legal liability, fines, damages and other costs. Although we take\nsteps to protect the security of our customers\u2019 personal information, we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach\nrequirements if third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect\nto customers\u2019 personal information. A major breach of our network security and systems could have serious negative consequences for our businesses\nand future prospects, including possible fines, penalties and damages, reduced customer demand for our vehicles, and harm to our reputation and\nbrand. We may be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other actions, which could adversely affect our brand image and financial\nperformance. Any product recall in the future may result in adverse publicity, damage our brand and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results\nand financial condition. We previously experienced product recalls in May 2009, October 2010 and June 2013, none of which was related to our electric\npowertrain. In April 2009, we determined that a condition caused by insufficient torqueing of the rear inner hub flange bolt existed in some of our Tesla\nRoadsters, as a result of a missed process during the manufacture of the Tesla Roadster glider. In October 2010, we initiated a product recall after the\n12 volt, low voltage auxiliary cable in a single vehicle chafed against the edge of a carbon fiber panel in the vehicle causing a short, smoke and possible\nfire behind the right front headlamp of the vehicle. In June 2013, we initiated a recall of slightly more than one thousand Model S vehicles to inspect\nand repair rear seat strikers that may have been compromised during the assembly process. Rear seat strikers are used to retain the rear seat backs in\nan upright position.",
  "Moreover, our\noperating results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts or investors. If any of this occurs, the trading price of our common stock could\nfall substantially, either suddenly or over time. Additionally, sales of new cars in the automobile industry typically decline over the winter season and are generally higher during the spring and\nsummer months. We anticipate that our sales of Model S and future models may have similar seasonality, but our limited operating history makes it\ndifficult for us to judge the exact nature or extent of the seasonality of our business. Our operating results could also suffer if we do not achieve revenue\nconsistent with our expectations for this seasonal demand because many of our expenses are based on anticipated levels of annual revenue. Unauthorized control or manipulation of our vehicles\u2019 systems may cause them to operate improperly or not at all, or compromise\ntheir safety and data security, which could result in loss of confidence in us and our vehicles and harm our business. There have been reports of vehicles of other automobile manufacturers being \u201chacked\u201d to grant access and operation of the vehicles to\nunauthorized persons and would-be thieves. Our vehicles, and in particular Model S, are technologically advanced machines requiring the\ninteroperation of numerous complex and evolving hardware and software systems. Subject to our customers\u2019 ability to opt out pursuant to our privacy\npolicy, Model S is designed with built-in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update the functionality\nof these systems. Although we have designed, implemented and tested security measures to prevent unauthorized access to our vehicles and their\nsystems, our information technology networks and communications with our vehicles may be vulnerable to interception, manipulation, damage,\ndisruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to errors by personnel who have access to our networks and systems. Any such\nattacks or breaches could result in unexpected control of or changes to our vehicles\u2019 functionality, user interface and performance\ncharacteristics. Hackers may also use similar means to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle, such as its current geographical\nposition, previous and stored destination address history and web browser \u201cfavorites.\u201d Any such unauthorized control of vehicles or access to or loss of\ninformation could result in legal claims or proceedings and negative publicity, which would negatively affect our brand and harm our business,\nprospects, financial condition and operating results. The range and power of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines over time, and this may negatively influence potential\ncustomers\u2019 decisions whether to purchase our vehicles.",
  "We do not expect any significant development services in future periods.",
  "We also produce and sell stationary energy storage products for use in homes, commercial sites, and utilities. The\napplications for these battery systems include backup power, peak demand reduction, demand response, and wholesale electric market services. 4\n\n \nWe manufacture our products primarily at our facilities in Fremont, California, Lathrop, California and Tilburg, Netherlands. We are developing\nthe Tesla Gigafactory, a facility where we intend to work together with our suppliers to integrate battery precursor material, cell, module and battery\npack production at a site near Reno, Nevada. We plan to use the battery packs manufactured at the Gigafactory for our vehicles, starting initially for\nModel S and Model X in 2016, and later for our Model 3 vehicle, as well as for stationary storage applications. Our Vehicles and Products\nWe currently design, develop, manufacture and sell fully electric vehicles and electric powertrain components. We are currently selling primarily\nthe Model S. Model S\nModel S is a fully electric, four-door, five-adult passenger sedan that offers compelling range and performance with zero tailpipe emissions. We\nbegan customer deliveries in June 2012. As of December 31, 2014, we had delivered almost 57,000 Model S vehicles. Model S offers a range on a single charge of up to 265 miles as determined using the United States EPA\u2019s combined two-cycle city/highway test. To complement this range, we also offer the capability to fast charge Model S at our Supercharger facilities. In addition, we designed Model S to\nincorporate a modular battery pack in the floor of the vehicle, enabling it to be rapidly swapped out at certain of our service centers and specialized\ncommercial battery exchange facilities that we anticipate may be available in the future. The 60 kWh and 85 kWh battery pack versions of Model S have an effective base price of $62,400, and $72,400, respectively, in the United\nStates, assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a United States federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles. We offer performance and all-wheel drive dual motor system options with our 85 kWh Model S. The performance version of our All-Wheel Drive Dual\nMotor Model S accelerates from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 3.2 seconds, making it the quickest sedan in the world according to Motor Trend magazine. We believe Model S offers a unique combination of functionality, convenience, safety and styling without compromising performance and energy\nefficiency. With the battery pack in the floor of the vehicle and the motor and gearbox in line with the rear axle, our single motor Model S provides best\nin class storage space of 31.6 cubic feet, including storage under both the tailgate and the hood. By way of comparison, this storage space exceeds the\napproximately 14 cubic feet of storage available in the 2015 BMW 5 Series sedan and the approximately 18 cubic feet of storage available in the 2015\nCadillac XTS. In addition, we have designed Model S to include a third row with two rear-facing child seats, allowing us to offer seating for five adults\nand two children. Model S is also available with premium luxury features, including a 17 inch touch screen driver interface and our advanced autopilot\nsystem. Our autopilot system, which is being progressively enabled over time through over-the-air software updates, includes both safety features such\nas collision warning systems and automatic braking and convenience features such as traffic aware cruise control. Model S also offers advanced\nwireless connectivity, such as 3G connectivity, and driver customization of the infotainment and climate control systems of the vehicle. We believe the\ncombination of performance, safety, styling, convenience and energy efficiency of Model S positions it as a compelling alternative to other vehicles in\nthe luxury and performance segments. We have designed Model S to provide a lower cost of ownership as compared to other vehicles in its class. We consider the purchase price, cost\nof fuel and the cost of maintenance over a six year ownership period in this calculation. We assume comparable residual values, warranties, insurance\ncosts and promotions and assume that currently available consumer incentives are still available at the time of a Model S purchase. In addition to the\ncompetitive pricing of Model S relative to other premium vehicles, we estimate that customers of electric vehicles will enjoy lower fuel costs. For\nexample, assuming an average of 15,000 miles driven per year, an average electricity cost of 12.1 cents per kilowatt-hour and an average gasoline price\nof $2.83 per gallon over the full ownership of the vehicle which were the average electricity cost and premium gasoline price in the United States,\nrespectively, for December 2014, and based on our estimate of the energy efficiency of Model S, we estimate that our Model S could save approximately\n$1,600 per year less in fuel costs than a comparable premium internal combustion engine sedan. In international markets, where gasoline prices can be\n2-3 times those of the United States, the savings are greater. We have designed Model S with an adaptable platform architecture and common electric powertrain that we intend to leverage to create future\nelectric vehicle models, including our Model X. In particular, by designing our electric powertrain within the chassis to accommodate different vehicle\nbody styles, we believe that we can save significant time in future vehicle development. In addition, we believe our strategy of using currently available\nbattery cells will enable us to leverage improvements in cell chemistries and rapidly introduce planned vehicles with different range options. 5\n\n \nModel X\nOur Model X crossover is the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the Model S platform. This unique vehicle has been designed to\noffer the space and functionality of a sport utility vehicle while having high performance features such as our fully electric, all-wheel drive dual motor\nsystem. Model X will seat seven adults and incorporate a unique falcon wing door system for superior access to the second and third seating rows. We\nanticipate that the pricing of Model X will be similar to a comparably equipped Model S. We currently intend to begin customer deliveries of Model X in\nthe third quarter of 2015. After its initial launch in the United States, Model X will be sold in all the markets where Model S is available including in\nAsia and Europe. Model 3\nWe have also publicly announced our intent to develop a third generation electric vehicle, called Model 3, to be produced at the Tesla Factory. We intend to offer this vehicle at a lower price point and expect to produce it at higher volumes than our Model S. We expect that this vehicle will be\nintroduced in 2017. The Tesla Roadster\nOur first vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, is the first high-performance electric sports car. It can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in as little\nas 3.7 seconds and has a maximum speed of approximately 120 miles per hour. The Tesla Roadster also has a range of 245 miles on a single charge, as\ndetermined using the United States EPA\u2019s combined two-cycle city/highway test. We have sold approximately 2,500 Tesla Roadsters to customers in\nover 30 countries, predominately in North America and Europe. We concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster in January 2012. Stationary Energy Storage Applications\nUsing the energy management technologies and manufacturing processes developed for our vehicle powertrain systems, we have developed\nstationary energy storage products for use in homes, commercial sites and utilities. The applications for these battery systems include backup power,\npeak demand reduction, demand response and wholesale electric market services. We began selling our home systems in 2013 and our commercial and\nutility systems in 2014. We plan to ramp sales of these products in 2015. Powertrain Development and Sales\nIn addition to our own vehicles, we also design, develop, manufacture and sell advanced electric vehicle powertrain components to other\nautomotive manufacturers. We have provided development services and full powertrain systems and components to Daimler for its Smart fortwo, A-\nClass, and B-Class electric vehicles and to Toyota for use in its RAV4 EV. We are continuing to supply production parts for the Daimler B class electric\nvehicle. Technology\nWe believe the core competencies of our company are powertrain engineering, vehicle engineering and innovative manufacturing. Our core\nintellectual property is contained within our electric powertrain and the ability to design a vehicle which capitalizes on the uniqueness of an electric\npowertrain. Our electric powertrain consists of the following: battery pack, power electronics, motor, gearbox and the control software which enables\nthe components to operate as a system. We designed each of these major elements for our Tesla Roadster and Model S and plan to use much of this\ntechnology in Model X, Model 3, our future electric vehicles and powertrain components that we build for other manufacturers. Our powertrain and\nbattery pack have a modular design, enabling future generations of electric vehicles and our stationary storage applications to incorporate a significant\namount of this technology. Further, our powertrain is very compact and contains far fewer moving parts than the internal combustion powertrain. These\nfeatures enable us to adapt it for a variety of applications, including our future vehicles and any powertrain components we build for other\nmanufacturers. Battery Pack\nWe design our battery packs to achieve high energy density at a low cost while also maintaining safety, reliability and long life. For example, we\nhave designed our Model S battery packs to store 85 kilowatt hours of useful energy and offer a warranty of unlimited miles over eight years. Our\nproprietary technology includes cooling systems, safety systems, charge balancing systems, battery engineering for vibration and environmental\ndurability, robotic manufacturing processes, customized motor design and the software and electronics management systems necessary to manage\nbattery and vehicle performance under demanding real-life driving conditions. We have significant experience and expertise in the safety and\nmanagement systems needed to work with lithium-ion cells in the demanding automotive environment. We believe these advancements have enabled us\nto produce a battery pack at a low cost per kilowatt-hour. 6\n\n \nWe have designed our battery pack system to permit flexibility with respect to battery cell chemistry, form factor and vendor. In so doing, we\nbelieve that we can leverage the substantial battery cell investments and advancements being made globally by battery cell manufacturers and\nourselves to continue to improve the cost per kilowatt-hour of our battery pack. We maintain an internal battery cell testing lab and an extensive\nperformance database of the many available lithium-ion cell vendors and chemistry types. We intend to incorporate the battery cells that provide the\nbest value and performance possible into our battery packs, and we expect this to continue over time as battery cells continue to improve in energy\nstorage capacity, longevity, power delivery and cost. We believe this flexibility will enable us to continue to evaluate new battery cells as they become\ncommercially viable, and thereby optimize battery pack system performance and cost for our current and future vehicles. In addition, we are designing\nthe cell manufacturing equipment for the Tesla Gigafactory to enable flexibility in terms of battery chemistry and form factor. We believe our ability to\nchange battery cell chemistries and vendors while retaining our existing investments in software, electronics, manufacturing equipment, testing and\nvehicle packaging, will enable us to quickly deploy various battery cells into our products and leverage the latest advancements in battery cell\ntechnology. The range of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines principally as a function of usage, time and charging patterns. Customers\u2019 use of\ntheir Tesla vehicle as well as the frequency with which they charge the battery of their Tesla vehicle can result in additional deterioration of the\nbattery\u2019s ability to hold a charge. For example, we currently expect that the Tesla Roadster battery pack will retain approximately 70% of its ability to\nhold its initial charge after approximately 100,000 miles or seven years, which will result in a decrease to the vehicle\u2019s initial range. In comparison with\nthe Roadster battery pack, preliminary internal testing and customer results of Model S to date suggest that the retention rate of the Model S battery\npack is greater, due to improvements at the battery cell and pack level. In addition, based on internal testing, we estimate that the Model S would have\nan approximate 5-10% reduction in range when operated continuously in 0\u00b0C temperatures. To date, we have tested hundreds of battery cells of different chemistries, form factors and designs. Based on this evaluation, we are presently\nusing lithium-ion battery cells based on the 18650 form factor in all of our battery packs. We intend to use the same battery cell form factor in Model X\nand entered into a supply agreement with Panasonic Corporation (Panasonic) for the use of Panasonic\u2019s battery cells in Model S and Model X. We\nexpect these battery cells to exhibit better performance and longer lifetimes than the battery cells used in the Tesla Roadster. Power Electronics\nThe power electronics in our electric powertrain govern the flow of electrical current throughout the car, primarily the current that flows into\nand out of the battery pack. The power electronics have two primary functions, the control of torque generation in the motor while driving and the\ncontrol of energy delivery back into the battery pack while charging. The first function is accomplished through the drive inverter, which converts direct current (DC) from the battery pack into alternating current\n(AC) to drive our three-phase induction motors. The drive inverter also converts the AC generated by regenerative braking back into DC for electrical\nstorage in the battery pack. The drive inverter performs this function by using a high-performance digital signal processor which runs some of the most\ncomplicated and detailed software in the vehicle. In so doing, the drive inverter is directly responsible for the performance, high efficiency and overall\ndriving experience of the vehicle. The second function, charging the battery pack, is accomplished by the charger, which converts alternating current (usually from a wall outlet or\nother electricity source) into direct current that can be accepted by the battery. Tesla vehicles can recharge on a variety of AC electrical sources, from a\ncommon outlet to a high power circuit of up to 22kW, which provides faster recharging. Vehicles in both the United States and Europe come with the\nTesla Mobile Connector which enables charging from a variety of different outlets. In other markets, Tesla offers a Tesla Wall Connector that can be\nhardwired at a wide range of power levels to suit the electrical capabilities of the charging location. The most common home charging system uses a standard high power and Mobile Connector to charge overnight. On the road, customers can\nalso charge using our Supercharger network or at a variety of destinations that have deployed our charging equipment. In addition, Model S vehicles\ncan also charge at a variety of public charging stations around the world, either natively or through a suite of adapters. This flexibility in charging\nprovides customers with additional mobility, while also allowing them to conveniently charge the vehicle overnight at home. 7\n\n \nVehicle Control and Infotainment Software\nThe performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs require sophisticated control software. There are numerous\nprocessors in our vehicles to control these functions, and we write custom firmware for many of these processors. The flow of electricity between the\nbattery pack and the motor must be tightly controlled in order to deliver the performance and behavior expected in the vehicle. For example, software\nalgorithms enable the vehicle to mimic the \u201ccreep\u201d feeling which drivers expect from an internal combustion engine vehicle without having to apply\npressure on the accelerator. Similar algorithms control traction, vehicle stability and the sustained acceleration and regenerative braking of the vehicle. Software also is used extensively to monitor the charge state of each of the cells of the battery pack and to manage all of its safety systems. Drivers use\nthe information and control systems in our vehicles to optimize performance, customize vehicle behavior, manage charging modes and times and control\nall infotainment functions. We develop almost all of this software, including most of the user interfaces, internally. We are also developing expertise in\nvehicle autopilot systems, including road tracking, lane changing, automated parking, driver warning systems and automated braking functions. Vehicle Design and Engineering\nIn addition to the design, development and production of the powertrain, we have created significant in-house capabilities in the design and\nengineering of electric vehicles and electric vehicle components and systems. We design and engineer bodies, chassis, interiors, heating and cooling\nand low voltage electrical systems in house and to a lesser extent in conjunction with our suppliers. Our team has core competencies in computer aided\ndesign and crash test simulations which we expect to reduce the product development time of new models. Several traditional automotive subsystems required substantial redesign and custom optimization to integrate with the powertrain of an electric\nvehicle. For example, we redesigned the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system to integrate with the battery thermal management\nsystem and to operate without the energy generated from an internal combustion engine. We have developed expertise in integrating these components\nwith the high-voltage power source in the vehicle and in designing components that significantly reduce their load on the vehicle battery pack, thereby\nmaximizing the available range of the vehicle. Additionally, our team has expertise in lightweight materials, a very important characteristic for electric vehicles given the impact of mass on\nrange. Model S is built with a lightweight aluminum body and chassis which incorporates a variety of materials and production methods that help\noptimize the weight of the vehicle. Sales and Marketing\nCompany-Owned Stores and Galleries\nWe market and sell cars directly to consumers through an international network of company-owned stores and galleries. Our Tesla stores and\ngalleries are highly visible, premium outlets in major metropolitan markets, some of which combine retail sales and service. We have also found that\nopening a service center in a new geographic area can increase demand. As a result, we have complemented our store strategy with sales facilities and\npersonnel in service centers to more rapidly expand our retail footprint. We refer to these as \u201cService Plus\u201d locations. Including all of our sales, Service\nPlus and service facilities, we operated 159 locations around the world as of December 31, 2014. We believe that by owning our own sales and service network we can offer a compelling customer experience while achieving operating\nefficiencies and capturing sales and service revenues incumbent automobile manufacturers do not enjoy in the traditional franchised distribution and\nservice model. Our customers deal directly with our own Tesla-employed sales and service staff, creating what we believe is a differentiated buying\nexperience from the buying experience consumers have with franchised automobile dealers and service centers. We believe we will also be able to\nbetter control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand, and obtain rapid customer feedback. Further, we believe that by owning our sales network we will avoid the conflict of interest in the traditional dealership structure inherent to most\nincumbent automobile manufacturers where the sale of warranty parts and repairs by a dealer are a key source of revenue and profit for the dealer but\noften are an expense for the vehicle manufacturer. 8\n\n \nTesla Supercharger Network\nWe are building a network of up to 120 kW fast charging equipment, each called a Tesla Supercharger, throughout North America, Europe and\nAsia for fast charging of Model S and future Tesla vehicles. Our Supercharger network is a strategic corporate initiative designed to remove a barrier to\nthe broader adoption of electric vehicles caused by the perception of limited vehicle range and to provide free charging access to Tesla\u2019s existing\ncustomers. The Tesla Supercharger is an industrial grade, high speed charger designed to replenish 170 miles of range in the battery pack in as little\nas 30 minutes. Supercharger stations typically have between four to ten Superchargers and are strategically placed primarily along well-travelled\nhighways to allow Model S owners to enjoy long distance travel with convenient, minimal stops. We currently have 380 Supercharger stations open in\nNorth America, Europe, and Asia. Access to the Supercharger network is currently available free of charge to owners of Model S vehicles with the 85\nkWh battery pack options and when purchased as an upfront option for 60 kWh. We are planning to methodically expand the Supercharger network\nover the next few years in the United States, Europe and Asia. Destination Charging\nWe are working with a wide variety of locations, including hotels and popular destinations, to offer an additional charging option for our\ncustomers. These destination charging partners deploy our wall connectors and provide charging free of charge to Model S owners. Almost 1,000\nlocations in Asia and North America currently have 1,800 Tesla wall connectors installed. We plan to expand the Destination Charging program into\nEurope in Q2 of this year. Orders and Reservations\nWe typically carry a very limited inventory of our Model S vehicles at our Tesla stores.",

  "Additionally, we amortized all remaining unamortized debt issuance costs related to the DOE Loan Facility. California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority Tax Incentives\nIn December 2009, we finalized an arrangement with the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority\n(CAEATFA) that resulted in an exemption from California state sales and use taxes for the purchase of $320 million of manufacturing equipment. As the\nequipment purchased would otherwise have been subject to California state sales and use tax, we believe this incentive resulted in tax savings by us of\napproximately $31 million over the period starting in December 2009 and ending in December 2013. The equipment purchases were used for three\npurposes: (i) to establish our production facility for Model S in California, (ii) to upgrade our Palo Alto powertrain production facility, and (iii) to expand\nour Tesla Roadster assembly operations at our Menlo Park facility. We exhausted all funds from the December 2009 approved exemption from\nCalifornia state sales and use taxes for $320 million of manufacturing equipment in December 2013. In January 2012, we finalized an additional agreement with CAEATFA for an exclusion from California state sales and use taxes for the purchase\nof up to $292 million of manufacturing equipment. To the extent all of this equipment is purchased and would otherwise be subject to California state\nsales or use tax, we believe this incentive would result in tax savings by us of up to approximately $24 million over the period starting in December\n2011 and ending in December 2015. The equipment purchased under this exclusion may only be used for two purposes: (i) to develop Model X and its\nproduction capacity in California and (ii) to further upgrade our powertrain production facilities in California. We have not yet exhausted the $292\nmillion in funds approved by CAEATFA in 2012. In December 2013, we finalized a third agreement with CAEATFA that will result in an exclusion from California state sales and use taxes for an\nadditional $415 million of manufacturing equipment. To the extent all of this equipment is purchased and would otherwise be subject to California state\nsales or use tax, we believe this 2013 incentive would result in tax savings by us of up to approximately $35 million over the period starting in\nDecember 2013 and ending in December 2016. The equipment purchased under this exclusion may only be used for three purposes: (i) to expand Model\nS manufacturing capacity in California; (ii) to expand electric vehicle powertrain production in California; and (iii) future Model S electric vehicle\ndevelopment. 12\n\n \nRegulatory Credits\nIn connection with the production, delivery, and placement into service of our zero emission vehicles in global markets, we have earned and will\ncontinue to earn various tradable regulatory credits that can be sold to other manufacturers. Under California\u2019s Zero-Emission Vehicle Regulations and those of states that have adopted the California standards, vehicle manufacturers are\nrequired to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in those states during each model year are zero-emission vehicles and partial zero-\nemission vehicles. Currently, the states of Arizona, California, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York,\nOregon, Rhode Island and Vermont have such laws in effect. These laws provide that a manufacturer may earn credits, referred to as ZEV credits, if\nthey produce more zero-emission vehicles than the minimum quantity required by those laws. Those manufacturers with a surplus of credits may sell\nthe excess credits to other manufacturers who can then apply such credits to comply with the regulatory requirements, including making up for deficits. As a manufacturer solely of zero-emission vehicles, we have no minimum requirement, and therefore earn ZEV credits on each vehicle delivered and\nplaced into service in such states. We have entered into agreements with other automobile manufacturers to sell the ZEV credits that we earn. Recently,\nCalifornia passed amendments to the ZEV mandate that would require, starting in 2018, all large-volume manufacturers (those manufacturers selling\n20,000 or more vehicles in California in 2018) to increase the number of zero emission vehicles sold, such that 15.4% of each manufacturers\u2019 fleet must\nbe made of zero emission vehicles by 2025. All states that have adopted the California program will amend their programs to conform to the new\nCalifornia standards. Additionally, under the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) national greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards and similar standards\nadopted by the Canadian government, car and truck manufacturers are required to meet fleet-wide average carbon dioxide emissions standards. Manufacturers who fail to meet such standards have a deficit in their emission profile. Manufacturers whose fleet wide average performs better than\nsuch standards may earn credits. Manufacturers may sell excess credits to other manufacturers, who can use the credits to comply with these\nregulatory requirements. As a manufacturer solely of zero emission vehicles, we earn the full amount of GHG credits established by the standards on\neach vehicle sold. We have contracted with another automobile manufacturer to sell all earned credits. Under the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s (NHTSA) Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, car and truck\nmanufacturers are required to meet fleet-wide average fuel economy standards. Manufacturers that fail to meet such standards have a deficit in their\nfuel economy profile. Manufacturers whose fleet-wide average performs better than such standards may earn credits. Manufacturers may sell excess\ncredits to other manufacturers, who can use such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements. We have entered into agreements to sell the\ncredits that we earn. Regulation\u2014Vehicle Safety and Testing\nOur vehicles are subject to, and comply with or are otherwise exempt from, numerous regulatory requirements established by NHTSA, including\nall applicable United States Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). The Model S fully complies with all FMVSSs without the need for any\nexemptions. The Roadster complies with or is exempt from all FMVSS. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSS, as well as the NHTSA bumper standard, or otherwise are\nexempt, before the vehicles can be imported or sold in the United States. Numerous FMVSS apply to our vehicles, such as crash-worthiness\nrequirements, crash avoidance requirements, and electric vehicle requirements. We are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by\nNHTSA, including the CAFE standards, Theft Prevention Act requirements, consumer information labeling requirements, Early Warning Reporting\nrequirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls, and owner\u2019s manual requirements. The Automobile Information and Disclosure Act requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the\nmanufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, the Act allows inclusion of city and highway fuel economy ratings, as\ndetermined by EPA, as well as crash test ratings as determined by NHTSA if such tests are conducted. Our vehicles sold in outside of the U.S. are subject to foreign safety testing regulations. Many of those regulations are different from the federal\nmotor vehicle safety standards applicable in the United States and may require redesign and/or retesting. Regulation\u2014EPA Emissions & Certificate of Conformity\nThe Clean Air Act requires that we obtain both an EPA-issued Certificate of Conformity and a California Air Resources Board (CARB)-issued\nExecutive Order with respect to emissions for our vehicles. The Certificate of Conformity is required for vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air\nAct\u2019s standards and both the Certificate of Conformity and the Executive Order are required for vehicles sold in states that have sought and received a\nwaiver from the EPA to utilize California standards. The California standards for emissions control for certain regulated pollutants for new vehicles and\nengines sold in California are set by CARB. States that have adopted the California standards as approved by EPA also recognize the Executive Order\nfor sales of vehicles. 13\n\n \nRegulation\u2014Battery Safety and Testing\nOur battery pack conforms to mandatory regulations that govern transport of \u201cdangerous goods\u201d, defined to include lithium-ion batteries, which\nmay present a risk in transportation. The governing regulations, issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), are\nbased on the United Nations (UN) Recommendations and Model Regulations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, as well as related UN Manual Tests\nand Criteria. The regulations vary by mode of shipping transportation, such as by ocean vessel, rail, truck, or air. We have completed the applicable\ntransportation tests for our prototype and production battery packs, demonstrating our compliance with the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria. We also\nsubject our battery packs to the appropriate tests specified in the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) J2464 and J2929 standards, which incorporate\ntests such as immersion, humidity, and exposure to fire. We use lithium metal oxide cells in our high voltage battery packs. The cells do not contain any lead, mercury, cadmium, other hazardous\nmaterials, heavy metals, or toxic materials. Our battery packs include certain packaging materials that contain trace amounts of hazardous chemicals\nwhose use, storage, and disposal is regulated under federal law. We currently have an agreement with a third party battery recycling company to\nrecycle our battery packs. If a customer wishes to dispose of a battery pack from one of our vehicles, we anticipate accepting the depleted battery from\nthe customer without any additional charge. Automobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation\nState laws regulate the manufacture, distribution, and sale of automobiles, and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be\nlicensed in order to sell vehicles directly to consumers in the state.",
  "Although the cost of this\nrecall was not material, and limited to a small number of total Model S\u2019s produced, we may experience additional recalls in the future, which could\nadversely affect our brand in our target markets, as well as our business, prospects and results of operations. In January 2014 we implemented a firmware update to address issues with certain Universal Mobile Connector NEMA 14-50 adapters, which are\npart of the charging units and are not part of the vehicles themselves, potentially overheating during charging. We further announced that we would\nprovide upgraded NEMA 14-50 adapters to our customers as an additional safeguard. If such measures do not adequately address the underlying\nconcerns, our business, prospects and results of operations could be harmed. Our electric vehicles may not perform consistent with customers\u2019 expectations or consistent with other vehicles currently available. For example,\nour electric vehicles may not have the durability or longevity of current vehicles, and may not be as easy to repair as other vehicles currently on the\nmarket. Additionally, while Model S recently achieved an overall five star safety rating by NHTSA, there is no guarantee that future model years or\nvariants or other Tesla vehicles will also attain such safety ratings, and any such rating is not a guarantee of safe product design or that any individual\nvehicle will be free of any defect or failure. Any product defects or any other failure of our performance electric vehicles to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in\nadverse publicity, lost revenue, delivery delays, product recalls, product liability claims, harm to our brand and reputation, and significant warranty and\nother expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. 18\n\n \nWe are dependent on our suppliers, the majority of which are single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to continue\nto deliver, or their refusal to deliver, necessary components of our vehicles in a timely manner at prices, quality levels, and volumes\nacceptable to us would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Model S contains numerous purchased parts which we source globally from over 300 direct suppliers, the majority of whom are currently single\nsource suppliers for these components. We expect that Model X will be sourced in an approximately similar manner. While we obtain components from\nmultiple sources whenever possible, similar to other automobile manufacturers, the majority of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by\nus from single sources. To date we have not qualified alternative sources for most of the single sourced components used in our vehicles and we do not\nmaintain long-term agreements with a number of our suppliers. While we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships and can obtain or engineer replacement components for our\nsingle source components, we may be unable to do so in the short term, or at all, at prices or costs that are favorable to us. In particular, while we\nbelieve that we will be able to secure alternate sources of supply for most of our single sourced components in a relatively short time frame, qualifying\nalternate suppliers or developing our own replacements for certain highly customized components of our vehicles may be time consuming, costly and\nmay force us to make additional modifications to a vehicle\u2019s design. This limited supply chain exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or component shortages for our vehicles, as well as for our\npowertrain component sales activities. For example, earthquakes similar to the one that occurred in Japan in March 2011 or labor issues such as work\nstoppages or strikes at the ports on the west coast could negatively impact our supply chain. We have in the past experienced source disruptions in our\nsupply chains, including those relating to our slower-than-anticipated ramp in our Model S production goals for 2012. We may experience additional\ndelays in the future with respect to Model S, Model X and any other future vehicle we may produce. In addition, because we have written agreements in place with the majority, but not all, of our suppliers, this may create uncertainty regarding a\nsupplier\u2019s obligations to us, including but not limited to, those regarding warranty and product liability. Changes in business conditions, wars,\ngovernmental changes and other factors beyond our control or which we do not presently anticipate, could also affect our suppliers\u2019 ability to deliver\ncomponents to us on a timely basis. Furthermore, if we experience significantly increased demand, or need to replace certain existing suppliers, there\ncan be no assurance that additional supplies of component parts will be available when required on terms that are favorable to us, at all, or that any\nsupplier would allocate sufficient supplies to us in order to meet our requirements or fill our orders in a timely manner. In the past, we have replaced\ncertain suppliers because of their failure to provide components that met our quality control standards. The loss of any single or limited source supplier\nor the disruption in the supply of components from these suppliers could lead to delays in vehicle deliveries to our customers, which could hurt our\nrelationships with our customers and also materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Changes in our supply chain have resulted in the past, and may result in the future, in increased cost and delay. We have also experienced cost\nincreases from certain of our suppliers in order to meet our quality targets and development timelines as well as due to design changes that we made,\nand we may experience similar cost increases in the future. Additionally, we are negotiating with existing suppliers for cost reductions, seeking new and\nless expensive suppliers for certain parts, and attempting to redesign certain parts to make them cheaper to produce. If we are unsuccessful in our\nefforts to control and reduce supplier costs, our operating results will suffer. Additionally, cost reduction efforts may interrupt or harm our normal\nproduction processes, thereby harming vehicle quality or reducing Model S production output. Furthermore, a failure by our suppliers to provide the components in a timely manner or at the level of quality necessary to manufacture our\nperformance electric vehicles could prevent us from fulfilling customer orders in a timely fashion which could result in negative publicity, damage our\nbrand and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Finally, in October 2013, we entered into an amendment to our existing supply agreement with Panasonic Corporation in order to address our\nanticipated short- to medium-term lithium-ion battery cell needs. While we expect that this supply agreement, as amended, will provide us with\nsufficient cells for the next few years, we may not be able to meet our long-term needs, including for Model 3 and other programs we may introduce,\nwithout securing additional suppliers or other sources for cells. We have recently signed an agreement with Panasonic to be our partner in the\nGigafactory and be responsible for, among other things, manufacturing cells from there for use in our products. If we encounter unexpected difficulties\nwith our current suppliers, including Panasonic, and if we are unable to fill these needs from other suppliers, we could experience production delays,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. 19\n\n \nOur future growth is dependent upon consumers\u2019 willingness to adopt electric vehicles. Our growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumers of, and we are subject to an elevated risk of any reduced demand for,\nalternative fuel vehicles in general and electric vehicles in particular. If the market for electric vehicles in North America, Europe and Asia does not\ndevelop as we expect, or develops more slowly than we expect, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be harmed. The\nmarket for alternative fuel vehicles is relatively new, rapidly evolving, characterized by rapidly changing technologies, price competition, additional\ncompetitors, evolving government regulation and industry standards, frequent new vehicle announcements and changing consumer demands and\nbehaviors. Other factors that may influence the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles, and specifically electric vehicles, include:\n\u25cf\nperceptions about electric vehicle quality, safety (in particular with respect to lithium-ion battery packs), design, performance and cost,\nespecially if adverse events or accidents occur that are linked to the quality or safety of electric vehicles, such as those related to the\nChevrolet Volt battery pack fires or incidents involving Model S;\n\u25cf\nperceptions about vehicle safety in general, in particular safety issues that may be attributed to the use of advanced technology, including\nvehicle electronics and regenerative braking systems;\n\u25cf\nnegative perceptions of electric vehicles, such as that they are more expensive than non-electric vehicles and are only affordable with\ngovernment subsidies;\n\u25cf\nthe limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge and the effects of weather on this range;\n\u25cf\nthe decline of an electric vehicle\u2019s range resulting from deterioration over time in the battery\u2019s ability to hold a charge;\n\u25cf\nvaried calculations for driving ranges achievable by EVs, which is inherently difficult given numerous factors affecting battery range;\n\u25cf\nconcerns about electric grid capacity and reliability, which could derail our past and present efforts to promote electric vehicles as a\npractical solution to vehicles which require gasoline;\n\u25cf\nconcerns by potential customers that if their battery pack is not charged properly, it may become unusable and may need to be replaced;\n\u25cf\nthe availability of alternative fuel vehicles, including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles;\n\u25cf\nimprovements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine;\n\u25cf\nthe availability of service for electric vehicles;\n\u25cf\nconsumers\u2019 desire and ability to purchase a luxury automobile or one that is perceived as exclusive;\n\u25cf\nthe environmental consciousness of consumers;\n\u25cf\nvolatility in the cost of oil and gasoline;\n\u25cf\nconsumers\u2019 perceptions of the dependency of the United States on oil from unstable or hostile countries;\n\u25cf\ngovernment regulations and economic incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of energy as well as tax and other\ngovernmental incentives to purchase and operate electric vehicles;\n\u25cf\naccess to charging facilities, standardization of electric vehicle charging systems and consumers\u2019 perceptions about convenience and cost\nto charge an electric vehicle; and\n\u25cf\nperceptions about and the actual cost of alternative fuel. In addition, reports have suggested the potential for extreme temperatures to affect the range or performance of electric vehicles, and based on\nour own internal testing, we estimate that our vehicles may experience a material reduction in range when operated in extremely cold temperatures. To\nthe extent customers have concerns about such reductions or third party reports which suggest reductions in range greater than our estimates gain\nwidespread acceptance, our ability to market and sell our vehicles, particularly in colder climates, may be adversely impacted. 20\n\n \nAdditionally, we will become subject to regulations that require us to alter the design of our vehicles, which could negatively impact consumer\ninterest in our vehicles. For example, our electric vehicles make less noise than internal combustion vehicles. Due to concerns about quiet vehicles and\nvision impaired pedestrians, in January 2011, Congress passed and the President signed the Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2010. The new law\nrequires NHTSA to establish minimum sounds for electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles when travelling at low speeds. NHTSA issued a notice of\nproposed rulemaking in 2013 and plans to finalize a rule as soon as sometime in 2015 with a potential effective date for implementation as early as\n2018. This will begin a three year phase-in schedule for establishing these minimum sounds in all electric and hybrid electric vehicles. Adding this\nartificial noise may cause current or potential customers not to purchase our electric vehicles, which would materially and adversely affect our business,\noperating results, financial condition and prospects. If we fail to manage future growth effectively as we rapidly grow our company, especially internationally, we may not be able to\nproduce, market, sell and service our vehicles successfully. Any failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial\ncondition. We continue to expand our operations significantly in North America as well as in Europe and Asia. Our future operating results depend to a\nlarge extent on our ability to manage this expansion and growth successfully. Risks that we face in undertaking this global expansion include:\n\u25cf\nfinding and training new personnel, especially in new markets such as Europe and Asia;\n\u25cf\ncontrolling expenses and investments in anticipation of expanded operations;\n\u25cf\nestablishing or expanding sales, service and Supercharger facilities in a timely manner;\n\u25cf\nadapting our products to meet local requirements in countries around the world; and\n\u25cf\nimplementing and enhancing manufacturing, logistics and administrative infrastructure, systems and processes. We intend to continue to hire a significant number of additional personnel, including manufacturing personnel, design personnel, engineers and\nservice technicians. Because our high-performance vehicles are based on a different technology platform than traditional internal combustion engines,\nwe may not be able to hire individuals with sufficient training in electric vehicles, and we will need to expend significant time and expense training the\nemployees we do hire. Competition for individuals with experience designing, manufacturing and servicing electric vehicles is intense, and we may not\nbe able to attract, assimilate, train or retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future, the failure of which could seriously harm our business,\nprospects, operating results and financial condition. If we are unable to adequately reduce the manufacturing costs of Model S, control manufacturing costs for Model X or otherwise\ncontrol the costs associated with operating our business, our financial condition and operating results will suffer. Our production costs for Model S were high initially due to start-up costs at the Tesla Factory, manufacturing inefficiencies including low\nabsorption of fixed manufacturing costs, higher logistics costs due to the immaturity of our supply chain, and higher initial prices for component parts\nduring the initial period after the launch and ramp of Model S. As we have gradually ramped production of Model S, manufacturing costs per vehicle\nhave decreased. While we expect further cost reductions to be realized by both us and our suppliers during the next several quarters, there is no\nguarantee we will be able to achieve sufficient cost savings to reach our gross margin and profitability goals. We incur significant costs related to procuring the raw materials required to manufacture our high-performance electric cars, assembling\nvehicles and compensating our personnel. We may also incur substantial costs or cost overruns in increasing the production capability of Model S and\npowertrain manufacturing facilities and the recent launch in Asia. Furthermore, if we are unable to produce Model X pursuant to our plan due to cost\noverruns or other unexpected costs, we may not be able to meet our gross margin targets. Furthermore, many of the factors that impact our operating costs are beyond our control. For example, the costs of our raw materials and\ncomponents, such as lithium-ion battery cells or aluminum used to produce body panels, could increase due to shortages as global demand for these\nproducts increases. Indeed, if the popularity of electric vehicles exceeds current expectations without significant expansion in battery cell production\ncapacity and advancements in battery cell technology, shortages could occur which would result in increased material costs to us or potentially limit our\nability to expand production. Additionally, we may be required to incur substantial marketing costs and expenses to promote our vehicles, including\nthrough the use of traditional media such as television, radio and print, even though our marketing expenses to date have been relatively limited as we\nhave to date relied upon unconventional marketing efforts. If we are unable to keep our operating costs aligned with the level of revenues we generate,\nour operating results, business and prospects will be harmed. 21\n\n \nWe may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business, which would cause our stock price to\ndecline. We occasionally provide guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance, such as projections regarding the number of\nvehicles we hope to sell, produce or deliver in future periods and anticipated future revenues, gross margins, profitability and cash flows. Correctly\nidentifying the key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process. Our guidance is based in part\non assumptions which include, but are not limited to, assumptions regarding:\n\u25cf\nour ability to achieve anticipated production and sales volumes and projected average sales prices for Model S and Model X in North\nAmerica, Europe and Asia;\n\u25cf\nsupplier and commodity-related costs; and\n\u25cf\nplanned cost reductions. Such guidance may not always be accurate or may vary from actual results due to our inability to meet our assumptions and the impact on our\nfinancial performance that could occur as a result of the various risks and uncertainties to our business as set forth in these risk factors, or because of\nthe way that applicable accounting rules require us to treat new product and service offerings that we may offer. We offer no assurance that such\nguidance will ultimately be accurate, and investors should treat any such guidance with appropriate caution. If we fail to meet our guidance or if we find\nit necessary to revise such guidance, even if such failure or revision is seemingly insignificant, investors and analysts may lose confidence in us and the\nmarket value of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. Our vehicles make use of lithium-ion battery cells, which have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame, and such events\nhave raised concerns, and future events may lead to additional concerns, about the batteries used in automotive applications. The battery pack in our vehicles and the battery packs that we sell to Toyota and Daimler make use of lithium-ion cells. On rare occasions,\nlithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other\nlithium-ion cells. Extremely rare incidents of laptop computers, cell phones and electric vehicle battery packs catching fire have focused consumer\nattention on the safety of these cells. These events have raised concerns about the batteries used in automotive applications. To address these questions and concerns, a number of\ncell manufacturers are pursuing alternative lithium-ion battery cell chemistries to improve safety. We have designed the battery pack to passively\ncontain any single cell\u2019s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells. However, we have delivered only a limited number of our vehicles to\ncustomers and have limited field experience with them. We have also only delivered a limited number of battery packs to Toyota and Daimler. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, which could\ndamage the vehicle or lead to personal injury or death and may subject us to lawsuits. We may have to recall our vehicles or participate in a recall of a\nvehicle that contains our battery packs, and redesign our battery packs, which would be time consuming and expensive. Also, negative public\nperceptions regarding the suitability of lithium-ion cells for automotive applications or any future incident involving lithium-ion cells such as a vehicle or\nother fire, even if such incident does not involve us, could seriously harm our business. In addition, we store a significant number of lithium-ion cells at our manufacturing facility. Any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption\nto the operation of our facilities. While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a\nsafety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations. Such damage or injury would likely lead to adverse publicity and potentially a\nsafety recall. Moreover, any failure of a competitor\u2019s electric vehicle, especially those that use a high volume of commodity cells similar to Tesla\u2019s\nvehicles, may cause indirect adverse publicity for us and our electric vehicles. Such adverse publicity would negatively affect our brand and harm our\nbusiness, prospects, financial condition and operating results.",
  "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report, which could materially affect\nour business, financial condition and future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Risks and uncertainties not\ncurrently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating\nresults. 15\n\n \nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry  \nWe may experience significant delays or other complications in the design, manufacture, launch and production ramp of Model X, as\nwell as future vehicles such as Model 3, which could harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We may experience significant delays or other complications in bringing new vehicles to market. For example, while we expect Model X\ndeliveries to start in the third quarter of 2015, refinements resulting from ongoing development and extensive testing of this vehicle could result in\ndelays in its introduction. Complications could also arise from other factors, including the expansion of our production capacity required to bring Model\nX to market, finalization of it supply chain, and completion of regulatory approvals. Ahead of the Model X launch, we plan to expand capacity in several\nareas for our current and future vehicles, including installing a state of the art, highly automated casting and machining operation for various aluminum\ncomponents for our vehicles, increasing production on our new drive unit line, installing a new robotic body assembly shop for Model X production and\ncommissioning a new paint facility. Our suppliers may not be able to provide components in a timely manner, at an acceptable price or in the necessary\nquantities. Finally, we will also need to do extensive testing to ensure that Model X is in compliance with applicable NHTSA safety regulations and\nobtain EPA and CARB certification to emission regulations prior to beginning volume production and delivery of the vehicles. We, as well as other automobile manufacturers, have experienced delays or other complications in connection with new vehicle models. In 2012,\nwe experienced delays in the production ramp of Model S and in 2014, we delayed the start of production ramp of All-Wheel Drive Dual Motor Model S. Any significant delay or other complication in the development, manufacture, launch and production ramp of Model X or our future vehicles, including\ncomplications associated with expanding our production capacity, supply chain or regulatory approvals, could materially damage our brand, business,\nprospects, financial condition and operating results. Our long-term success will be dependent upon our ability to design, build and achieve market acceptance of new vehicle models,\nspecifically Model S and new vehicle models such as Model X and Model 3. Our long-term success is dependent on market acceptance of the Model S sedan and future electric vehicles we introduce. In the United States,\nthere is no guarantee that Model S will continue to be successfully accepted by the general public, especially in the long-term. As we expand in Europe\nand Asia, there is no guarantee that customers in these markets will embrace our vehicles and if they do not, demand for our vehicles could be lower\nthan our expectations. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will be able to design future electric vehicles that will meet the expectations of our customers or\nthat our future models, including the Model X crossover, will become commercially viable. To date, we have publicly revealed only an early prototype of\nthe Model X. Work continues on the finalization of Model X with Beta Model X vehicles undergoing extensive testing. To the extent that we are not able\nto build Model X in accordance with the expectations created by the early prototype and our announced specifications and schedule, customers may\ncancel their reservations, our future sales could be harmed and investors may lose confidence in us. In addition, we have also announced our intent to develop Model 3 which we expect to produce at the Tesla Factory after the introduction of\nModel X. We intend to offer this vehicle at a lower price point and expect to produce it at higher volumes than our Model S. Importantly, we anticipate\nproducing Model 3 for the mass market and thus we will need a high-volume supply of lithium-ion cells at reasonable prices. While we intend each of our production vehicles and their variants to meet a distinct segment of the automotive market, our vehicles may end up\ncompeting with each other which may delay sales and associated revenue to future periods. Also, if we fail to accurately anticipate demand for each of\nour vehicles, this could result in inefficient expenditures and production delays. Furthermore, historically, automobile customers have come to expect\nnew and improved vehicle models to be introduced frequently. In order to meet these expectations, we may be required to introduce on a regular basis\nnew vehicle models as well as enhanced versions of existing vehicle models. As automotive technologies change, including those specific to electric\nvehicles, we anticipate our customers will expect us to upgrade or adapt our vehicles and introduce new models in order to continue to provide vehicles\nwith the latest technology. To date, we have limited experience simultaneously designing, testing, manufacturing, upgrading, adapting and selling our\nelectric vehicles as well as limited experience allocating our available resources among the design and production of multiple vehicles. 16\n\n \nWe may be unable to increase production and deliveries of Model S in line with our plans, both of which could harm our business and\nprospects. Since we began manufacturing and delivering Model S in 2012, we have significantly increased production and deliveries, and our plans call for\nan even greater increase in production and deliveries going forward. As part of this effort, we recently completed a new final assembly line and added\nmore automation to our body shop at the Fremont factory, are installing a highly automated casting and machining operation for various aluminum\ncomponents and are finishing the construction of a new high volume paint shop. Our ability to further ramp-up high volume Model S production,\nincluding for the All-Wheel Drive Dual Motor Model S, which we recently began producing for the first time, will depend upon a number of factors,\nincluding our ability to use these new manufacturing processes as planned while maintaining our desired quality levels, our suppliers\u2019 ability to deliver\nquality parts to us in a timely manner, and efficiently making design changes to ensure consistently high quality. To produce a vehicle that meets our\nquality standards requires us to carefully analyze each step of our production plan, improve the efficiency of our manufacturing processes and continue\nto train our employees. Our suppliers also must produce new products in sufficient quantities and quality to meet our demand. Certain suppliers have\nexperienced delays in meeting our demand or have sought to renegotiate the terms of the supply arrangements, and we continue to focus on supplier\ncapabilities and constraints. Any disruption in increasing our production level of Model S in line with our plans could materially damage our brand,\nbusiness, prospects, financial condition and operating results. In addition, for Model S we have introduced a number of new manufacturing technologies and techniques, such as aluminum spot welding\nsystems, which have not been widely adopted in the automotive industry; and the Model S has a number of new and unique design features, such as a\n17 inch display screen, retractable exterior door handles, and all-new dual motor and autopilot hardware, each of which poses unique manufacturing\nchallenges. Model S production and deliveries will continue to require significant resources and we may experience unexpected delays or difficulties\nthat could harm our ability to maintain full manufacturing capacity for Model S, or cause us to miss planned production targets, any of which could have\na material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Additionally, sustaining high volume production and doing so in a manner that\navoids significant cost overruns, including as a result of factors beyond our control such as problems with suppliers and vendors, may be difficult. Concurrent with the significant increase in our planned production levels, we will also need to continue to significantly increase our deliveries of\nModel S vehicles. We have limited experience in delivering a high volume of Model S vehicles, and, in particular, to locations outside of the United\nStates. We may face difficulties meeting our delivery and growth plans in Asia and the right hand drive markets we have entered, which may impact our\nability to achieve our worldwide delivery goals. If we are unable to ramp up to meet our delivery goals globally to match our production rate of Model S,\nthis could result in negative publicity, damage our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and\noperating results. Our ability to grow volume production and deliveries for Model S is subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u25cf\nthat our suppliers will be able and willing to deliver components on a timely basis and in the necessary quantities, quality and at\nacceptable prices to produce Model S in volume and reach our financial targets;\n\u25cf\nthat we will be able to complete any necessary adjustments to the vehicle design or manufacturing processes of Model S in a timely\nmanner that meets our production plan and allows for high quality vehicles;\n\u25cf\nthat we will be able to fully ramp production of All-Wheel Drive Dual Motor Model S to keep up with demand;\n\u25cf\nthat we will be able to ramp sales of Model S throughout Asia, pursuant to our current timeline;\n\u25cf\nthat we will be able to adequately respond in a timely manner to any problems that may arise with our vehicles;\n\u25cf\nthat we will be able to schedule and complete deliveries at our planned higher volume production levels;\n\u25cf\nthat the equipment or tooling which we have purchased or which we select, including those that are part of our higher capacity production\nline that recently became operational, will be able to accurately manufacture the vehicle within specified design tolerances, and will not\nsuffer from unexpected breakdowns or damage which could negatively affect the rate needed to produce vehicles in volume;\n\u25cf\nthat we will be able to comply with environmental, workplace safety, customs and similar regulations required to operate our\nmanufacturing facilities;\n\u25cf\nthat we will be able to maintain and improve quality controls as we transition to a higher level of in-house manufacturing process; and\n\u25cf\nthat the information technology systems that we are currently expanding and improving upon will be effective to manage higher volume\nproduction. Finally, detailed long-term testing of quality, reliability and durability of Model S is ongoing and any negative results from such testing could\ncause production or delivery delays, cost increases, or lower quality of our Model S vehicles. 17\n\n \nProblems or delays in bringing the Gigafactory online and operating it in line with our expectations could negatively affect us. To lower the cost of cell production and produce cells in volume to allow us to grow quickly, we intend to integrate the production of lithium-ion\ncells and finished battery packs for our vehicles at our new Gigafactory. Our Gigafactory plan, however, is at an early stage. While we recently entered\ninto various formal agreements with Panasonic on the Gigafactory, we have very little experience in building a factory of the size and scope planned for\nthe Gigafactory, and no experience directly in the production of lithium-ion cells. In addition, to date we have not finalized agreements with additional\nGigafactory partners that will be co-located at the Gigafactory. Also, the cost of building and operating the Gigafactory could exceed our current\nexpectations and the Gigafactory may take longer to bring online than we anticipate. If we are unable to build the Gigafactory in a timely manner to\nproduce high volumes of quality lithium-ion cells at reasonable prices, then our ability to supply battery packs to our vehicles, including Model 3,\naccording to our schedule and/or at a price that allows us to sell them profitably and in the quantities we estimate could be constrained. Any such\nproblems or delays with Gigafactory could negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. If our vehicles or vehicles that contain our powertrains fail to perform as expected, or if we suffer product recalls, our ability to\ndevelop, market and sell our electric vehicles could be harmed. Our vehicles or vehicles that contain our powertrains such as the Toyota RAV4 EV or the Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV may contain defects in\ndesign and manufacture that may cause them not to perform as expected or that may require repair. For example, our vehicles are highly dependent on\nsoftware to operate. Software products are inherently complex and often contain defects and errors when first introduced, and changes to software may\nhave unexpected effects. Model S issues experienced by customers include those related to the software for the 17 inch display screen, the panoramic\nroof and the 12 volt battery. Although we attempt to remedy the Model S issues experienced by our customers in a rapid manner, such efforts may not\nbe timely or up to the satisfaction of our customers. While we have performed extensive internal testing, we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate the long-term\nperformance of our battery packs, powertrains and vehicles. Specifically, we have only a limited amount of data by which to evaluate Model S, upon\nwhich our business prospects depend, due to the fact that we only recently began production in June 2012. There can be no assurance that we will be\nable to detect and fix any defects in the vehicles prior to their sale to consumers. We have experienced product recalls, including in May 2009, October 2010, and June 2013, all of which were unrelated to our electric\npowertrain. In May 2009, we initiated a product recall after we determined that a condition caused by insufficient torqueing of the rear inner hub flange\nbolt existed in some of our Tesla Roadsters, as a result of a missed process during the manufacture of the Tesla Roadster glider, which is the partially\nassembled Tesla Roadster that does not contain our electric powertrain. In October 2010, we initiated a product recall for some of our Tesla Roadsters\nafter the 12 volt, low voltage auxiliary cable in a single vehicle chafed against the edge of a carbon fiber panel in the vehicle causing a short, smoke and\npossible fire behind the right front headlamp of the vehicle. In June 2013, we initiated a recall of slightly more than a thousand Model S vehicles to\ninspect and repair rear seat strikers that may have been compromised during the assembly process. Rear seat strikers are used to retain the rear seat\nbacks in an upright position. Failure of this component may have resulted in the collapse of the rear seat back during a crash.",
  "Although none of our employees are currently represented by a labor union, it is common throughout the automobile industry generally for many\nemployees at automobile companies to belong to a union, which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages. Our\nemployees may join or seek recognition to form a labor union, or we may be required to become a union signatory. Our automobile production facility in\nFremont, California was purchased from NUMMI. Prior employees of NUMMI were union members and our future work force at this facility may be\ninclined to vote in favor of forming a labor union. We also own and operate another component manufacturing facility in Lathrop,\nCalifornia. Furthermore, we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as parts suppliers and trucking and\nfreight companies, and work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or\noperating results. If a work stoppage occurs, it could delay the manufacture and sale of our performance electric vehicles and have a material adverse\neffect on our business, prospects, operating results or financial condition. The mere fact that our labor force could be unionized may harm our\nreputation in the eyes of some investors and thereby negatively affect our stock price. Consequently, the unionization of our labor force could negatively\nimpact the company\u2019s health. 32\n\n \nWe are subject to substantial regulation, which is evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations\ncould substantially harm our business and operating results. The production and sale of motor vehicles, in general and specifically related to electric vehicles, are subject to substantial regulation under\ninternational, federal, state, and local laws. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant costs in complying with these regulations. Regulations related to the electric vehicle industry and alternative energy are currently evolving and we face risks associated with changes to\nthese regulations. In the United States, the following are examples of regulatory and statutory issues facing us:\n\u25cf\nthe imposition of a carbon tax or the introduction of a cap-and-trade system on electric utilities could increase the cost of electricity;\n\u25cf\nincreasingly stringent Clean Air Act emission regulations affecting power plants used to generate electricity could increase the cost of\nelectricity;\n\u25cf\nchanges to the regulations governing the assembly and transportation of lithium-ion battery packs, such as the UN Recommendations of\nthe Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods Model Regulations or regulations adopted by the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety\nAdministration (PHMSA) could increase the cost of lithium-ion battery packs or restrict their transport;\n\u25cf\nthe amendment or rescission of the federal law and regulations mandating increased fuel economy in the United States, referred to as the\nCorporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, could reduce new business opportunities for our powertrain sales and development\nactivities;\n\u25cf\nthe amendment or rescission of federal greenhouse gas tailpipe emission regulations administered by EPA under the authority of the Clean\nAir Act could reduce new business opportunities for our powertrain sales and development activities;\n\u25cf\nthe amendment or rescission of California\u2019s zero emission vehicle  (ZEV) regulations administered by the California Air Resources Board\nunder the California Health & Safety Code could reduce new business opportunities for our powertrain sales and development activities,\nas well as our ability to monetize ZEV credits not only in California, but also in the eleven additional states that have adopted the\nCalifornia program;\n\u25cf\nincreased sensitivity by regulators to the needs of established automobile manufacturers with large employment bases, high fixed costs\nand business models based on the internal combustion engine could lead them to pass regulations that could reduce the compliance costs\nof such established manufacturers or mitigate the effects of government efforts to promote alternative fuel vehicles;\n\u25cf\nchanges to the vehicle-specific Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, which govern how all motor vehicles are made within the United\nStates, could result in costly changes to how current vehicles are produced; and\n\u25cf\nchanges to regulations governing the export of our products could increase our delivery costs to outside the United States or force us to\ncharge consumers in such jurisdictions a higher price for our vehicles. In addition, as the automotive industry moves towards greater use of electronics in vehicle systems, NHTSA and other regulatory bodies may\nregulate these electronic systems more stringently, particularly as concerns about distracted driving increase."

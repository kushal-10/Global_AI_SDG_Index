  "Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\n \n92\n \n \n \nSignatures\n \n98\n \n \n \n2\n\n \nForward-Looking Statements\nThe discussions in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations that\ninvolve risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning our strategy,\nfuture operations, future financial position, future revenues, projected costs, profitability, expected cost reductions, capital adequacy,\nexpectations regarding demand and acceptance for our technologies, growth opportunities and trends in the market in which we operate,\nprospects and plans and objectives of management. The words \u201canticipates\u201d, \u201cbelieves\u201d, \u201cestimates\u201d, \u201cexpects\u201d, \u201cintends\u201d, \u201cmay\u201d,\n\u201cplans\u201d, \u201cprojects\u201d, \u201cwill\u201d, \u201cwould\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-\nlooking statements contain these identifying words. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our\nforward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Actual results or events could\ndiffer materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements that we make. These forward-\nlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-\nlooking statements, including, without limitation, the risks set forth in Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-\nK and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking\nstatements.",
  "Moreover, our\noperating results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts or investors. If any of this occurs, the trading price of our common stock could\nfall substantially, either suddenly or over time. Additionally, sales of new cars in the automobile industry typically decline over the winter season and are generally higher during the spring and\nsummer months. We anticipate that our sales of Model S and future models may have similar seasonality, but our limited operating history makes it\ndifficult for us to judge the exact nature or extent of the seasonality of our business. Our operating results could also suffer if we do not achieve revenue\nconsistent with our expectations for this seasonal demand because many of our expenses are based on anticipated levels of annual revenue. Unauthorized control or manipulation of our vehicles\u2019 systems may cause them to operate improperly or not at all, or compromise\ntheir safety and data security, which could result in loss of confidence in us and our vehicles and harm our business. There have been reports of vehicles of other automobile manufacturers being \u201chacked\u201d to grant access and operation of the vehicles to\nunauthorized persons and would-be thieves. Our vehicles, and in particular Model S, are technologically advanced machines requiring the\ninteroperation of numerous complex and evolving hardware and software systems. Subject to our customers\u2019 ability to opt out pursuant to our privacy\npolicy, Model S is designed with built-in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update the functionality\nof these systems. Although we have designed, implemented and tested security measures to prevent unauthorized access to our vehicles and their\nsystems, our information technology networks and communications with our vehicles may be vulnerable to interception, manipulation, damage,\ndisruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to errors by personnel who have access to our networks and systems. Any such\nattacks or breaches could result in unexpected control of or changes to our vehicles\u2019 functionality, user interface and performance\ncharacteristics. Hackers may also use similar means to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle, such as its current geographical\nposition, previous and stored destination address history and web browser \u201cfavorites.\u201d Any such unauthorized control of vehicles or access to or loss of\ninformation could result in legal claims or proceedings and negative publicity, which would negatively affect our brand and harm our business,\nprospects, financial condition and operating results. The range and power of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines over time, and this may negatively influence potential\ncustomers\u2019 decisions whether to purchase our vehicles.",
  "Should market values or customer demand decrease, these estimates may be impacted\nmaterially. The Tesla Gigafactory\nWe are developing the Tesla Gigafactory, a facility where we intend to work together with our suppliers to integrate battery precursor material,\ncell, module and battery pack production in one location. In June 2014, we broke ground on the Gigafactory outside of Reno, Nevada. Construction\ncontinued during the end of 2014 at an accelerated pace with first cells expected to be produced in 2016 for use in Model S and Model X. While our plan is to produce lithium-ion cells and finished battery packs at the Gigafactory, our plans for such production are at a very early\nstage. We have no experience in the production of lithium-ion cells, and accordingly we intend to engage partners with significant experience in cell\nproduction. We recently formalized our agreement with Panasonic to partner on the Gigafactory. Panasonic will invest in production equipment that it\nwill use to manufacture and supply us with battery cells. We will prepare and provide the land, buildings and utilities for the Gigafactory, invest in\nproduction equipment for battery module and pack production and be responsible for the overall management of the Gigafactory. We anticipate\nbringing on additional partners for the Gigafactory to create a fully integrated industrial complex. Although planning discussions with production and\nsupply chain partners continue to progress well, to date we have not formalized any agreements with any other partners. In addition, the cost of\nbuilding and operating the Gigafactory could exceed our current expectations and the Gigafactory may take longer to bring online than we anticipate. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The\npreparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other\nassumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period\nto period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and\nassumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial\nstatement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the following critical accounting\npolicies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the\nmost critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition\nAutomotive Sales\nWe recognize automotive sales revenue from sales of Model S, including vehicle options, accessories and destination charges, vehicle service and\nsales of regulatory credits, such as ZEV and greenhouse gas emission (GHG) credits. We also recognize automotive sales revenue from the sales of\nelectric vehicle powertrain components and systems, such as battery packs and drive units, to other manufacturers. Revenue is recognized when\n(i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; (iii) fees are\nfixed or determinable; and (iv) collection is reasonably assured. Car sales include certain standard features and customer selected options and configurations that meet the definition of a deliverable under\nmultiple-element accounting guidance, including internet connectivity, Supercharging access, and specified software updates for cars equipped with\nAutopilot hardware. These deliverables are valued on a stand-alone basis and we recognize their related revenue over our performance period which is\ngenerally the eight-year life of the car or, for software upgrades, as they are delivered. If we sell a derivable separately, we use that pricing to\ndetermine its fair value; otherwise, we use our best estimated selling price by considering third party pricing of similar options, costs used to develop\nand deliver the service, and other information which may be available. 49\n\n \nResale Value Guarantee\nWe offer a resale value guarantee program to customers who purchase a Model S and finance their vehicle through one of our commercial\nbanking partners in the US, Canada and Europe. Under this program, Model S customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the\nperiod from 36 to 39 months after delivery for a specified value determined at time of purchase. Because we offer a resale value guarantee, we account\nfor these transactions as operating leases. Accordingly, we recognize revenue attributable to the lease on a straight-line basis over the guarantee period\nto automotive sales revenue. Similarly, we capitalize the cost of the leased vehicle and depreciate its value, less expected salvage value, to cost of\nautomotive sales over the same period. At the end of the guarantee period, which is the earlier of 39 months or the pay-off date of the initial loan, the resale value guarantee and\ndeferred revenue balances are settled to automotive sales revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to costs of automotive sales\nif our customer retains ownership of the car. In cases where a customer returns the vehicle back to us between months 36 and 39, we issue a check to\nthe customer in the amount of the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred revenue balance to automotive sales revenue. At least annually, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our resale value guarantee program. As we accumulate more data\nrelated to the resale values of Model S, there may be significant changes to their estimated values. Maintenance and Service Plans\nWe offer a prepaid maintenance program for Model S, which includes plans covering maintenance for up to eight years or up to 100,000 miles,\nprovided these services are purchased within a specified period of time. The maintenance plans cover annual inspections and the replacement of wear\nand tear parts, excluding tires and the battery, with either a fixed fee per visit for Tesla Ranger service or unlimited Tesla Ranger visits for a higher\ninitial purchase price. Payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated\nbalance sheets and recognized in automotive sales as we fulfill our performance obligations. We also offer an extended service plan, which covers the repair or replacement of Model S parts for an additional four years or up to an\nadditional 50,000 miles, after the end of our initial New Vehicle Limited Warranty, provided they are purchased within a specified period of time. For\ncustomers that are not covered by our New Vehicle Limited Warranties or our extended service plans, we offer Tesla Ranger service at a higher cost. Payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and\nrecognized in automotive sales ratably over the service coverage periods. We provided Tesla Roadster customers with the opportunity to purchase an extended warranty plan for the period after the end of our initial\nNew Vehicle Limited Warranty to cover additional services for an additional three years or 36,000 miles. We refer to this program as our Extended\nService plan. Amounts collected on these sales are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in\nautomotive sales over the extended warranty period. Additionally, we have previously provided customers of our Tesla Roadsters with a one-time option to replace the battery packs in their vehicles\nat any time after the expiration of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty but before the tenth anniversary of the purchase date of their vehicles. We refer to\nthis program as our Battery Replacement program. Amounts collected on these sales are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated\nbalance sheets and recognized in automotive sales as we fulfill our obligation to replace the battery packs. Inventory Valuation\nWe value our inventories at the lower of cost or market.",
  "\u2020\nConfidential treatment has been requested for portions of this exhibit\n \n \n \n97\n\n \nSIGNATURES\nPursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed\non its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.",
  "Our design and vehicle engineering capabilities, combined with the technical\nadvancements of our powertrain system, have enabled us to design and develop electric vehicles that we believe overcome the design, styling, and\nperformance issues that have historically limited broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles. As a result, we believe our customers enjoy several\nbenefits, including:\n\u00b7\nLong Range and Recharging Flexibility. Our vehicles offer ranges that are over double the range of any other commercially available\nelectric vehicle. In addition, our vehicles incorporate our proprietary on-board charging system, permitting recharging from almost any\navailable electrical outlet. Model S also offers fast charging capability from our Supercharger network. We believe the long-range and\ncharging flexibility of our vehicles will help reduce consumer anxiety over range, alleviate the need for expensive, large-scale charging\ninfrastructure, and differentiate our vehicles as compared to those of our competitors. \u00b7\nEnergy Efficiency and Cost of Ownership. We believe our vehicles offer consumers an attractive cost of ownership when compared to\nsimilar internal combustion engine or hybrid electric vehicles. Using only an electric powertrain enables us to create a lighter, more\nenergy efficient vehicle that is mechanically simpler than currently available hybrid or internal combustion engine vehicles. We currently\nestimate that the cost to fuel our vehicles is approximately one-fourth that of comparable internal combustion vehicles in the United\nStates, and even less internationally where gasoline prices are typically higher. We also expect our electric vehicles will have lower\nrelative maintenance costs than hybrid, plug-in hybrid, or internal combustion engine vehicles due to fewer moving parts and the absence\nof certain components, including oil, oil filters, spark plugs and engine valves. Additionally, government incentives that are currently\navailable can reduce the cost of ownership even further. \u00b7\nHigh-Performance Without Compromised Design or Functionality.",
  "During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 regulatory credit sales were $216.3 million, $194.4 million, and $40.5 million. In April 2013, we launched our resale value guarantee program. During the year ending December 31, 2014, we delivered 5,224 cars and\nrecognized $128.2 million revenue under this program. During 2013 we delivered 5,179 under this program and recognized $29.1 million of revenue. As\nof December 31, 2014, we recorded $373.5 million in deferred revenues and $487.9 million in resale value guarantee related to Model S deliveries with\nthe resale value guarantee. As of December 31, 2013, we recorded $230.9 million in deferred revenues and $236.3 million in resale value guarantee\nrelated to Model S deliveries with the resale value guarantee\nPowertrain component and related sales for the periods presented were related to powertrain component sales to Daimler under the Mercedes-\nBenz B-Class Electric Drive program which commenced in April 2014 and to Toyota under the RAV4 EV program. Powertrain component and related\nsales for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $113.3 million, $45.1 million and $31.4 million. During the third quarter of 2014, we\ncompleted the RAV4 EV program. 53\n\n \nDevelopment Services\nDevelopment services represent arrangements where we develop electric vehicle powertrain components and systems for other automotive\nmanufacturers, including the design and development of battery packs, drive units and chargers to meet customers\u2019 specifications. We provided\ndevelopment services to Daimler and Toyota to assist in the development of electric powertrains for the Mercedes Benz B-Class EV and the Toyota\nRAV4. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recognized revenue under these arrangement in the amounts of $5.6 million,\n$15.7 million, $27.6 million.",
  "3\n\n \nPART I\n \nITEM  1. BUSINESS\nOverview\nWe design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, advanced electric vehicle powertrain components and\nstationary energy storage systems. We have established our own network of sales and service centers and Supercharger stations globally to accelerate\nthe widespread adoption of electric vehicles. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and business model differentiates us from\nincumbent automobile manufacturers. We are currently producing and selling our second vehicle, the Model S sedan. Model S is a four door, five-passenger premium sedan that offers\nexceptional performance, functionality and attractive styling. Model S inherited many of the electric powertrain innovations we introduced with our first\nvehicle, the Tesla Roadster. We commenced deliveries of Model S in June 2012 and as of December 31, 2014 we have delivered almost 57,000 Model S\nvehicles worldwide. Since its launch, Model S has won several awards, including the prestigious Motor Trend Car of the Year for 2013. Surveys by\nConsumer Reports gave Model S the highest customer satisfaction score of any car in the world in 2013 and gave Tesla Service the best overall\nsatisfaction rating in the entire automotive industry in 2015. Model S also earned the highest safety rating in the United States by the National Highway\nTraffic Safety Administration. We have continued to improve Model S by introducing performance, all-wheel drive dual motor, autopilot options, and\nfree over-the-air software updates. We anticipate commencing customer shipments of our third vehicle, the Model X crossover, in the third quarter of 2015. This unique vehicle has\nbeen designed to fill the niche between the roominess of a minivan and the style of an SUV, while having high performance features such as our all-\nwheel drive dual motor system and fast 0 to 60 miles per hour acceleration. After the Model X, our goal is to introduce the Model 3, a lower priced\nsedan designed for the mass market, in 2017. The commercial production of fully electric vehicles that meets consumers\u2019 range and performance expectations requires substantial design,\nengineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles.",
  "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report, which could materially affect\nour business, financial condition and future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Risks and uncertainties not\ncurrently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating\nresults. 15\n\n \nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry  \nWe may experience significant delays or other complications in the design, manufacture, launch and production ramp of Model X, as\nwell as future vehicles such as Model 3, which could harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We may experience significant delays or other complications in bringing new vehicles to market. For example, while we expect Model X\ndeliveries to start in the third quarter of 2015, refinements resulting from ongoing development and extensive testing of this vehicle could result in\ndelays in its introduction. Complications could also arise from other factors, including the expansion of our production capacity required to bring Model\nX to market, finalization of it supply chain, and completion of regulatory approvals. Ahead of the Model X launch, we plan to expand capacity in several\nareas for our current and future vehicles, including installing a state of the art, highly automated casting and machining operation for various aluminum\ncomponents for our vehicles, increasing production on our new drive unit line, installing a new robotic body assembly shop for Model X production and\ncommissioning a new paint facility. Our suppliers may not be able to provide components in a timely manner, at an acceptable price or in the necessary\nquantities. Finally, we will also need to do extensive testing to ensure that Model X is in compliance with applicable NHTSA safety regulations and\nobtain EPA and CARB certification to emission regulations prior to beginning volume production and delivery of the vehicles. We, as well as other automobile manufacturers, have experienced delays or other complications in connection with new vehicle models. In 2012,\nwe experienced delays in the production ramp of Model S and in 2014, we delayed the start of production ramp of All-Wheel Drive Dual Motor Model S. Any significant delay or other complication in the development, manufacture, launch and production ramp of Model X or our future vehicles, including\ncomplications associated with expanding our production capacity, supply chain or regulatory approvals, could materially damage our brand, business,\nprospects, financial condition and operating results. Our long-term success will be dependent upon our ability to design, build and achieve market acceptance of new vehicle models,\nspecifically Model S and new vehicle models such as Model X and Model 3. Our long-term success is dependent on market acceptance of the Model S sedan and future electric vehicles we introduce. In the United States,\nthere is no guarantee that Model S will continue to be successfully accepted by the general public, especially in the long-term. As we expand in Europe\nand Asia, there is no guarantee that customers in these markets will embrace our vehicles and if they do not, demand for our vehicles could be lower\nthan our expectations. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will be able to design future electric vehicles that will meet the expectations of our customers or\nthat our future models, including the Model X crossover, will become commercially viable. To date, we have publicly revealed only an early prototype of\nthe Model X. Work continues on the finalization of Model X with Beta Model X vehicles undergoing extensive testing. To the extent that we are not able\nto build Model X in accordance with the expectations created by the early prototype and our announced specifications and schedule, customers may\ncancel their reservations, our future sales could be harmed and investors may lose confidence in us. In addition, we have also announced our intent to develop Model 3 which we expect to produce at the Tesla Factory after the introduction of\nModel X. We intend to offer this vehicle at a lower price point and expect to produce it at higher volumes than our Model S. Importantly, we anticipate\nproducing Model 3 for the mass market and thus we will need a high-volume supply of lithium-ion cells at reasonable prices. While we intend each of our production vehicles and their variants to meet a distinct segment of the automotive market, our vehicles may end up\ncompeting with each other which may delay sales and associated revenue to future periods. Also, if we fail to accurately anticipate demand for each of\nour vehicles, this could result in inefficient expenditures and production delays. Furthermore, historically, automobile customers have come to expect\nnew and improved vehicle models to be introduced frequently. In order to meet these expectations, we may be required to introduce on a regular basis\nnew vehicle models as well as enhanced versions of existing vehicle models. As automotive technologies change, including those specific to electric\nvehicles, we anticipate our customers will expect us to upgrade or adapt our vehicles and introduce new models in order to continue to provide vehicles\nwith the latest technology. To date, we have limited experience simultaneously designing, testing, manufacturing, upgrading, adapting and selling our\nelectric vehicles as well as limited experience allocating our available resources among the design and production of multiple vehicles. 16\n\n \nWe may be unable to increase production and deliveries of Model S in line with our plans, both of which could harm our business and\nprospects. Since we began manufacturing and delivering Model S in 2012, we have significantly increased production and deliveries, and our plans call for\nan even greater increase in production and deliveries going forward. As part of this effort, we recently completed a new final assembly line and added\nmore automation to our body shop at the Fremont factory, are installing a highly automated casting and machining operation for various aluminum\ncomponents and are finishing the construction of a new high volume paint shop. Our ability to further ramp-up high volume Model S production,\nincluding for the All-Wheel Drive Dual Motor Model S, which we recently began producing for the first time, will depend upon a number of factors,\nincluding our ability to use these new manufacturing processes as planned while maintaining our desired quality levels, our suppliers\u2019 ability to deliver\nquality parts to us in a timely manner, and efficiently making design changes to ensure consistently high quality. To produce a vehicle that meets our\nquality standards requires us to carefully analyze each step of our production plan, improve the efficiency of our manufacturing processes and continue\nto train our employees. Our suppliers also must produce new products in sufficient quantities and quality to meet our demand. Certain suppliers have\nexperienced delays in meeting our demand or have sought to renegotiate the terms of the supply arrangements, and we continue to focus on supplier\ncapabilities and constraints. Any disruption in increasing our production level of Model S in line with our plans could materially damage our brand,\nbusiness, prospects, financial condition and operating results. In addition, for Model S we have introduced a number of new manufacturing technologies and techniques, such as aluminum spot welding\nsystems, which have not been widely adopted in the automotive industry; and the Model S has a number of new and unique design features, such as a\n17 inch display screen, retractable exterior door handles, and all-new dual motor and autopilot hardware, each of which poses unique manufacturing\nchallenges. Model S production and deliveries will continue to require significant resources and we may experience unexpected delays or difficulties\nthat could harm our ability to maintain full manufacturing capacity for Model S, or cause us to miss planned production targets, any of which could have\na material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Additionally, sustaining high volume production and doing so in a manner that\navoids significant cost overruns, including as a result of factors beyond our control such as problems with suppliers and vendors, may be difficult. Concurrent with the significant increase in our planned production levels, we will also need to continue to significantly increase our deliveries of\nModel S vehicles. We have limited experience in delivering a high volume of Model S vehicles, and, in particular, to locations outside of the United\nStates. We may face difficulties meeting our delivery and growth plans in Asia and the right hand drive markets we have entered, which may impact our\nability to achieve our worldwide delivery goals. If we are unable to ramp up to meet our delivery goals globally to match our production rate of Model S,\nthis could result in negative publicity, damage our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and\noperating results. Our ability to grow volume production and deliveries for Model S is subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u25cf\nthat our suppliers will be able and willing to deliver components on a timely basis and in the necessary quantities, quality and at\nacceptable prices to produce Model S in volume and reach our financial targets;\n\u25cf\nthat we will be able to complete any necessary adjustments to the vehicle design or manufacturing processes of Model S in a timely\nmanner that meets our production plan and allows for high quality vehicles;\n\u25cf\nthat we will be able to fully ramp production of All-Wheel Drive Dual Motor Model S to keep up with demand;\n\u25cf\nthat we will be able to ramp sales of Model S throughout Asia, pursuant to our current timeline;\n\u25cf\nthat we will be able to adequately respond in a timely manner to any problems that may arise with our vehicles;\n\u25cf\nthat we will be able to schedule and complete deliveries at our planned higher volume production levels;\n\u25cf\nthat the equipment or tooling which we have purchased or which we select, including those that are part of our higher capacity production\nline that recently became operational, will be able to accurately manufacture the vehicle within specified design tolerances, and will not\nsuffer from unexpected breakdowns or damage which could negatively affect the rate needed to produce vehicles in volume;\n\u25cf\nthat we will be able to comply with environmental, workplace safety, customs and similar regulations required to operate our\nmanufacturing facilities;\n\u25cf\nthat we will be able to maintain and improve quality controls as we transition to a higher level of in-house manufacturing process; and\n\u25cf\nthat the information technology systems that we are currently expanding and improving upon will be effective to manage higher volume\nproduction. Finally, detailed long-term testing of quality, reliability and durability of Model S is ongoing and any negative results from such testing could\ncause production or delivery delays, cost increases, or lower quality of our Model S vehicles. 17\n\n \nProblems or delays in bringing the Gigafactory online and operating it in line with our expectations could negatively affect us. To lower the cost of cell production and produce cells in volume to allow us to grow quickly, we intend to integrate the production of lithium-ion\ncells and finished battery packs for our vehicles at our new Gigafactory. Our Gigafactory plan, however, is at an early stage. While we recently entered\ninto various formal agreements with Panasonic on the Gigafactory, we have very little experience in building a factory of the size and scope planned for\nthe Gigafactory, and no experience directly in the production of lithium-ion cells. In addition, to date we have not finalized agreements with additional\nGigafactory partners that will be co-located at the Gigafactory. Also, the cost of building and operating the Gigafactory could exceed our current\nexpectations and the Gigafactory may take longer to bring online than we anticipate. If we are unable to build the Gigafactory in a timely manner to\nproduce high volumes of quality lithium-ion cells at reasonable prices, then our ability to supply battery packs to our vehicles, including Model 3,\naccording to our schedule and/or at a price that allows us to sell them profitably and in the quantities we estimate could be constrained. Any such\nproblems or delays with Gigafactory could negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. If our vehicles or vehicles that contain our powertrains fail to perform as expected, or if we suffer product recalls, our ability to\ndevelop, market and sell our electric vehicles could be harmed. Our vehicles or vehicles that contain our powertrains such as the Toyota RAV4 EV or the Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV may contain defects in\ndesign and manufacture that may cause them not to perform as expected or that may require repair. For example, our vehicles are highly dependent on\nsoftware to operate. Software products are inherently complex and often contain defects and errors when first introduced, and changes to software may\nhave unexpected effects. Model S issues experienced by customers include those related to the software for the 17 inch display screen, the panoramic\nroof and the 12 volt battery. Although we attempt to remedy the Model S issues experienced by our customers in a rapid manner, such efforts may not\nbe timely or up to the satisfaction of our customers. While we have performed extensive internal testing, we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate the long-term\nperformance of our battery packs, powertrains and vehicles. Specifically, we have only a limited amount of data by which to evaluate Model S, upon\nwhich our business prospects depend, due to the fact that we only recently began production in June 2012. There can be no assurance that we will be\nable to detect and fix any defects in the vehicles prior to their sale to consumers. We have experienced product recalls, including in May 2009, October 2010, and June 2013, all of which were unrelated to our electric\npowertrain. In May 2009, we initiated a product recall after we determined that a condition caused by insufficient torqueing of the rear inner hub flange\nbolt existed in some of our Tesla Roadsters, as a result of a missed process during the manufacture of the Tesla Roadster glider, which is the partially\nassembled Tesla Roadster that does not contain our electric powertrain. In October 2010, we initiated a product recall for some of our Tesla Roadsters\nafter the 12 volt, low voltage auxiliary cable in a single vehicle chafed against the edge of a carbon fiber panel in the vehicle causing a short, smoke and\npossible fire behind the right front headlamp of the vehicle. In June 2013, we initiated a recall of slightly more than a thousand Model S vehicles to\ninspect and repair rear seat strikers that may have been compromised during the assembly process. Rear seat strikers are used to retain the rear seat\nbacks in an upright position. Failure of this component may have resulted in the collapse of the rear seat back during a crash.",
  "Balance Sheet Components\nInventory\nAs of December 31, 2014 and 2013, our inventory consisted of the following (in thousands):\n \n \n \nDecember 31,   \nDecember 31,  \n \n \n2014\n  \n2013\n \nRaw materials\n $\n392,292  $\n184,665 \nWork in process\n  \n56,114   \n42,500 \nFinished goods\n  \n397,318   \n69,324 \nService parts\n  \n107,951   \n43,866 \nTotal\n $\n953,675  $\n340,355 \n \nFinished goods inventory includes vehicles made to fulfill customer orders which have not been delivered and a smaller portion of vehicles\navailable for immediate sale at our retail and service center locations. In addition, we also maintain vehicles used for marketing purposes and service\nloaners until they are sold to customers. We write down inventory as a result of excess and obsolete inventories, or when we believe that the net realizable value of inventories is less\nthan the carrying value. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recorded write-downs of $15.6 million, $8.9 million and $5.0\nmillion, respectively, in cost of automotive sales. 75\n\n \nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nAs of December 31, 2014 and 2013, our property, plant and equipment, net, consisted of the following (in thousands):\n \n \n \nDecember 31,   \nDecember 31,  \n \n \n2014\n  \n2013\n \nMachinery, equipment and office furniture\n $\n720,746  $\n322,394 \nTooling\n  \n295,906   \n230,385 \nLeasehold improvements\n  \n230,270   \n94,763 \nBuilding and building improvements\n  \n154,362   \n67,707 \nLand\n  \n49,478   \n45,020 \nComputer equipment and software\n  \n98,970   \n42,073 \nConstruction in progress\n  \n572,125   \n76,294 \n \n  \n2,121,857   \n878,636 \nLess: Accumulated depreciation and amortization\n  \n(292,590)   \n(140,142)\nTotal\n $\n1,829,267  $\n738,494 \n \nConstruction in progress is comprised primarily of assets related to the manufacturing of our Model S, including building improvements at our\nTesla Factory in Fremont, California as well as tooling and manufacturing equipment and capitalized interest expense.

  "MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear\nelsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview and 2014 Highlights\nWe design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, advanced electric vehicle powertrain components and\nstationary energy storage applications. We are currently producing and selling our second vehicle, the Model S sedan. Model S is a four door, five-\npassenger premium sedan that offers exceptional performance, functionality and attractive styling. The Model S inherited many of the electric\npowertrain innovations we introduced with our first vehicle, the Tesla Roadster. We commenced deliveries of Model S in June 2012 and have delivered\n56,768 vehicles through December 31, 2014. We recently announced the availability of our All-Wheel Drive Dual Motor Model S and began delivery,\nstarting with a performance-optimized version, in December 2014. We are continuing to develop our Model X crossover vehicle and intend to commence customer deliveries in the third quarter of 2015. After the\nModel X, our goal is to introduce Model 3, a lower priced sedan designed for the mass market, in 2017. Our primary source of revenue is from the sale of our vehicles. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized total revenues of $3.20\nbillion, an increase of $1.19 billion over total revenues of $2.01 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily driven by growth of Model S\ndeliveries worldwide. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 27.6%, a significant increase from 22.7% for the year ended December 31, 2013. Higher vehicle production volume, supply chain efficiencies and component cost reductions, partially offset by one-time manufacturing inefficiencies\nassociated with transitioning to our new final assembly line and introduction of All-Wheel Drive Dual Motor Model S, contributed to higher gross margin\nin 2014. Research and development (R&D) expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $464.7 million, an increase from $232.0 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2013. R&D expenses in 2014 reflected our engineering work on Model X as well as development work on our dual motor\npowertrain and other development programs including localization efforts for foreign markets. R&D expenses in 2013 reflected our activities on\nmanufacturing process improvements, Model S cost reductions, the right-hand drive Model S and localization efforts for foreign markets, as well as\ndevelopment work on Model X. During 2014, we significantly increased our sales and service footprint worldwide, entered several new markets including China, as well as\naccelerated the rollout of our Supercharging network. With the continued global expansion of our customer support infrastructure and the business in\ngeneral in 2014, selling, general and administrative expenses were $603.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $285.6 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2013. Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks\n \nOrders, Production and Deliveries\nOur orders for Model S in 2014 significantly increased from the prior year as we expanded our operations internationally and introduced Model S\nproduct enhancements. In October 2014, we revealed our All-Wheel Drive Dual Motor Model S and our Autopilot system. This version of Model S\nproved very popular, leading to over 10,000 unfulfilled orders as of January 1, 2015. We expect that demand for Model S will continue to increase\nworldwide as more people drive and become aware of our vehicles, as we grow our customer support infrastructure, and as we broaden the appeal of\nour products. As of December 31, 2014, we had received almost 20,000 reservations for Model X in advance of its planned introduction later this year. We are\ncontinuing to test the Beta Model X prototypes, and plan to begin building and testing a small fleet of release candidate Model X vehicles later in the\nfirst quarter of 2015. Our ability to launch the Model X program on time and cost efficiently is dependent upon a variety of factors, including\ncompletion of production tooling, supplier readiness, engineering completion and the successful completion of our validation testing. In order to meet this anticipated demand for both Model S and Model X, we are executing a plan to increase our combined Model S and Model X\nproduction capacity to over 2,000 units per week by the end of 2015. In August 2014, we began our production ramp by transitioning to our new final\nassembly line and upgrading our body center. We are planning further investments in production capacity during 2015, including building a new paint\nshop and a new body shop for Model X. We expect our annual production will increase by over 50% each year for the next several years. 47\n\n \nOur recent production capacity expansion contributed to several weeks of production in excess of 1,000 vehicles per week during the last few\nmonths of 2014. However, the changeover to our new final assembly line during the third quarter of 2014 and the introduction of All-Wheel Drive Dual\nMotor Model S onto this line during the fourth quarter of 2014 took longer than we expected. Consequently, we delivered fewer vehicles than we had\nplanned in 2014. During 2015, we plan to achieve significant efficiencies in Model S production and begin production of Model X with the intent of\nachieving a significantly faster initial production ramp than we achieved with Model S. Any unexpected issues with the expansion of our production\ncapacity or the launch and ramp of Model X production could affect our ability to meet future delivery targets. In addition to expanding our production, we expect to continue to lower the cost of manufacturing our vehicles and improve our gross\nmargin. Significant cost improvements for Model S were achieved in 2013 and 2014, including part cost reductions as well as manufacturing\nefficiencies. We expect that this trend will continue as we execute on our roadmap. We expect that such improvements, when combined with a favorable\nmix of vehicles, will allow us to achieve a 30% gross margin on Model S by the end of 2015, assuming no further deterioration in foreign\ncurrencies. However, we expect these cost improvements will be partially offset by production inefficiencies during the introduction of Model\nX. During our product introductions in 2014, we incurred manufacturing inefficiencies which negatively impacted our gross margin. When we\nintroduce Model X, we expect that both production inefficiencies and supply chain inefficiencies typical of a new product introduction will suppress\nModel X margins for at least a few quarters after its introduction. If we are not able to achieve the planned cost reductions from our various cost\nsavings and process improvement initiatives or introduce Model X efficiently, our ability to reach our gross margin goals would be negatively affected. We expect to deliver approximately 55,000 Model S and X vehicles worldwide in 2015, approximately 74% more deliveries than we achieved in\n2014. To support this growth, we plan to continue to expand our Supercharger, stores and service infrastructure worldwide as well as to provide better\nservice in areas with a high concentration of Model S customers. As we now offer Model S in countries throughout North America, Europe and Asia,\nour expansion will primarily occur in geographic areas in which we already have a presence. Based on our current projections, we expect our long-term\nsales outside of North America will increase to almost half of our worldwide automotive sales. Despite initial challenges in China, we plan to continue to\ninvest in our infrastructure in China as we believe that the country could be one of our largest markets within a few years. However, as compared to\nmarkets in the United States and Europe, we have relatively limited experience in Asian markets; thus, we may face continuing difficulties meeting our\nfuture expansion plans in Asia. Trends in Capital Expenditures and Operating Expenses\nOur capital expenditures and operating expenses significantly increased in 2014. As we continue to invest in the long term growth of Tesla,\ncapital spending and operating expenses will continue to increase, but at a more moderate pace than in 2014. During 2015, capital expenditures are\nexpected to be about $1.5 billion as we expand production capacity, complete Model X development, and invest in the Gigafactory, our stores and\nservice centers. We also plan to grow our Supercharger network by over 50% this year as well as continue other product development programs,\nincluding Model 3. Our operating expenses will continue to grow in 2015, but at less than half the pace of growth in 2014, or approximately 45% to 50%\nannualized. Our R&D expenses in particular will continue to increase as we complete the development, validation, and testing of Model X and\naccelerate design and engineering work on Model 3. Growth of sales, general and administrative expenses will be more modest as we will be\nparticularly focused on increasing operational efficiency while we continue to expand our customer and corporate infrastructure.",
  "The vast majority of our customers customize their vehicle\nby placing an order with us. We require a $2,500 payment to begin production for these, which is collected once the customer has selected the vehicle\nspecifications and has entered into a purchase agreement. In certain markets, we require additional payments a few weeks prior to delivery. We require\nall remaining payment of the purchase price of the vehicle upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. For Model X, which is currently not in production, we require an initial refundable reservation payment of at least $5,000. Reservation payments\nand deposits are used by us to fund, in part, our working capital requirements and help us to align production with demand. Marketing\nOur principal marketing goals are to:\n\u00b7\ngenerate demand for our vehicles and drive leads to our sales teams;\n\u00b7\nbuild long-term brand awareness and manage corporate reputation;\n\u00b7\nmanage our existing customer base to create loyalty and customer referrals; and\n\u00b7\nenable customer input into the product development process. Historically, we have been able to generate significant media coverage of our company and our vehicles, and we believe we will continue to do\nso. To date, media coverage and word of mouth have been the primary drivers of our sales leads and have helped us achieve sales without traditional\nadvertising and at relatively low marketing costs. Our marketing efforts include events where our vehicles are displayed and demonstrated.",
  "These events range from widely attended public\nevents, such as the Detroit, Los Angeles, and Frankfurt auto shows, to smaller events oriented towards sales, such as private drive events. Service and Warranty\nService\nWe provide service for our electric vehicles at our company-owned service centers, at our Service Plus locations or, in certain areas for an\nadditional charge, through Tesla Ranger mobile technicians who provide services that do not require a vehicle lift. We own and operate 95 service\nlocations as of December 31, 2014.",
  "Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-\nout basis. We record inventory write-downs for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories based upon assumptions about future demand\nforecasts. If our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written off. We also review inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This\nrequires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert inventory on hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do\nnot result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, material changes to these reserves may be required. A small change in\nour estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results. 50\n\n \nWarranties\nWe provide a warranty on all vehicles, production powertrain components and systems sales, and we accrue warranty reserves upon delivery to\ncustomer. Warranty reserves include management\u2019s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace any items under warranty.",
  "Such concerns could affect use of\nelectronic systems in Model S, such as the 17 inch display screen, which could reduce the appeal of Model S or require adjustments to the display\nscreen\u2019s functionality. As we are currently delivering vehicles in Europe and Asia, we are subject to laws and regulations applicable to the import, sale and service of\nautomobiles in those regions. For example, we are required to meet vehicle-specific safety standards that are often materially different from U.S. requirements, thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance. Unlike in the U.S. where we self-\ncertify our vehicles\u2019 compliance with standards, we must obtain advanced approval from regulatory agencies regarding the proper certification or\nhomologation of our vehicles to enter into these markets. This process necessitates that foreign regulatory officials review and certify our vehicles prior\nto market entry. In addition, we must comply with regulations applicable to vehicles after they enter the market, including foreign reporting\nrequirements and recall management systems. To the extent U.S. or international laws change, some or all of our vehicles may not comply with any new applicable international, federal, state\nor local laws, which would have an adverse effect on our business. Compliance with changing regulations could be burdensome, time consuming, and\nexpensive. To the extent compliance with new regulations is cost prohibitive, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be\nadversely affected. 33\n\n \nWe retain certain personal information about our customers and may be subject to various privacy and consumer protection laws. Our collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information of our customers is subject to federal, state, and international laws. These laws continue to be enacted and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with changing international laws may cause us\nto incur substantial costs, expose us to legal liability or require us to change our business practices. Our privacy policy is posted on our website, and\nany failure by us or our vendor or other business partners to comply with it or with federal, state or international privacy, data protection or security\nlaws or regulations could result in regulatory or litigation-related actions against us, legal liability, fines, damages and other costs. Although we take\nsteps to protect the security of our customers\u2019 personal information, we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach\nrequirements if third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect\nto customers\u2019 personal information. A major breach of our network security and systems could have serious negative consequences for our businesses\nand future prospects, including possible fines, penalties and damages, reduced customer demand for our vehicles, and harm to our reputation and\nbrand. We may be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other actions, which could adversely affect our brand image and financial\nperformance. Any product recall in the future may result in adverse publicity, damage our brand and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results\nand financial condition. We previously experienced product recalls in May 2009, October 2010 and June 2013, none of which was related to our electric\npowertrain. In April 2009, we determined that a condition caused by insufficient torqueing of the rear inner hub flange bolt existed in some of our Tesla\nRoadsters, as a result of a missed process during the manufacture of the Tesla Roadster glider. In October 2010, we initiated a product recall after the\n12 volt, low voltage auxiliary cable in a single vehicle chafed against the edge of a carbon fiber panel in the vehicle causing a short, smoke and possible\nfire behind the right front headlamp of the vehicle. In June 2013, we initiated a recall of slightly more than one thousand Model S vehicles to inspect\nand repair rear seat strikers that may have been compromised during the assembly process. Rear seat strikers are used to retain the rear seat backs in\nan upright position.",
  "We also produce and sell stationary energy storage products for use in homes, commercial sites, and utilities. The\napplications for these battery systems include backup power, peak demand reduction, demand response, and wholesale electric market services. 4\n\n \nWe manufacture our products primarily at our facilities in Fremont, California, Lathrop, California and Tilburg, Netherlands. We are developing\nthe Tesla Gigafactory, a facility where we intend to work together with our suppliers to integrate battery precursor material, cell, module and battery\npack production at a site near Reno, Nevada. We plan to use the battery packs manufactured at the Gigafactory for our vehicles, starting initially for\nModel S and Model X in 2016, and later for our Model 3 vehicle, as well as for stationary storage applications. Our Vehicles and Products\nWe currently design, develop, manufacture and sell fully electric vehicles and electric powertrain components. We are currently selling primarily\nthe Model S. Model S\nModel S is a fully electric, four-door, five-adult passenger sedan that offers compelling range and performance with zero tailpipe emissions. We\nbegan customer deliveries in June 2012. As of December 31, 2014, we had delivered almost 57,000 Model S vehicles. Model S offers a range on a single charge of up to 265 miles as determined using the United States EPA\u2019s combined two-cycle city/highway test. To complement this range, we also offer the capability to fast charge Model S at our Supercharger facilities. In addition, we designed Model S to\nincorporate a modular battery pack in the floor of the vehicle, enabling it to be rapidly swapped out at certain of our service centers and specialized\ncommercial battery exchange facilities that we anticipate may be available in the future. The 60 kWh and 85 kWh battery pack versions of Model S have an effective base price of $62,400, and $72,400, respectively, in the United\nStates, assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a United States federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles. We offer performance and all-wheel drive dual motor system options with our 85 kWh Model S. The performance version of our All-Wheel Drive Dual\nMotor Model S accelerates from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 3.2 seconds, making it the quickest sedan in the world according to Motor Trend magazine. We believe Model S offers a unique combination of functionality, convenience, safety and styling without compromising performance and energy\nefficiency. With the battery pack in the floor of the vehicle and the motor and gearbox in line with the rear axle, our single motor Model S provides best\nin class storage space of 31.6 cubic feet, including storage under both the tailgate and the hood. By way of comparison, this storage space exceeds the\napproximately 14 cubic feet of storage available in the 2015 BMW 5 Series sedan and the approximately 18 cubic feet of storage available in the 2015\nCadillac XTS. In addition, we have designed Model S to include a third row with two rear-facing child seats, allowing us to offer seating for five adults\nand two children. Model S is also available with premium luxury features, including a 17 inch touch screen driver interface and our advanced autopilot\nsystem. Our autopilot system, which is being progressively enabled over time through over-the-air software updates, includes both safety features such\nas collision warning systems and automatic braking and convenience features such as traffic aware cruise control. Model S also offers advanced\nwireless connectivity, such as 3G connectivity, and driver customization of the infotainment and climate control systems of the vehicle. We believe the\ncombination of performance, safety, styling, convenience and energy efficiency of Model S positions it as a compelling alternative to other vehicles in\nthe luxury and performance segments. We have designed Model S to provide a lower cost of ownership as compared to other vehicles in its class. We consider the purchase price, cost\nof fuel and the cost of maintenance over a six year ownership period in this calculation. We assume comparable residual values, warranties, insurance\ncosts and promotions and assume that currently available consumer incentives are still available at the time of a Model S purchase. In addition to the\ncompetitive pricing of Model S relative to other premium vehicles, we estimate that customers of electric vehicles will enjoy lower fuel costs. For\nexample, assuming an average of 15,000 miles driven per year, an average electricity cost of 12.1 cents per kilowatt-hour and an average gasoline price\nof $2.83 per gallon over the full ownership of the vehicle which were the average electricity cost and premium gasoline price in the United States,\nrespectively, for December 2014, and based on our estimate of the energy efficiency of Model S, we estimate that our Model S could save approximately\n$1,600 per year less in fuel costs than a comparable premium internal combustion engine sedan. In international markets, where gasoline prices can be\n2-3 times those of the United States, the savings are greater. We have designed Model S with an adaptable platform architecture and common electric powertrain that we intend to leverage to create future\nelectric vehicle models, including our Model X. In particular, by designing our electric powertrain within the chassis to accommodate different vehicle\nbody styles, we believe that we can save significant time in future vehicle development. In addition, we believe our strategy of using currently available\nbattery cells will enable us to leverage improvements in cell chemistries and rapidly introduce planned vehicles with different range options. 5\n\n \nModel X\nOur Model X crossover is the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the Model S platform. This unique vehicle has been designed to\noffer the space and functionality of a sport utility vehicle while having high performance features such as our fully electric, all-wheel drive dual motor\nsystem. Model X will seat seven adults and incorporate a unique falcon wing door system for superior access to the second and third seating rows. We\nanticipate that the pricing of Model X will be similar to a comparably equipped Model S. We currently intend to begin customer deliveries of Model X in\nthe third quarter of 2015. After its initial launch in the United States, Model X will be sold in all the markets where Model S is available including in\nAsia and Europe. Model 3\nWe have also publicly announced our intent to develop a third generation electric vehicle, called Model 3, to be produced at the Tesla Factory. We intend to offer this vehicle at a lower price point and expect to produce it at higher volumes than our Model S. We expect that this vehicle will be\nintroduced in 2017. The Tesla Roadster\nOur first vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, is the first high-performance electric sports car. It can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in as little\nas 3.7 seconds and has a maximum speed of approximately 120 miles per hour. The Tesla Roadster also has a range of 245 miles on a single charge, as\ndetermined using the United States EPA\u2019s combined two-cycle city/highway test. We have sold approximately 2,500 Tesla Roadsters to customers in\nover 30 countries, predominately in North America and Europe. We concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster in January 2012. Stationary Energy Storage Applications\nUsing the energy management technologies and manufacturing processes developed for our vehicle powertrain systems, we have developed\nstationary energy storage products for use in homes, commercial sites and utilities. The applications for these battery systems include backup power,\npeak demand reduction, demand response and wholesale electric market services. We began selling our home systems in 2013 and our commercial and\nutility systems in 2014. We plan to ramp sales of these products in 2015. Powertrain Development and Sales\nIn addition to our own vehicles, we also design, develop, manufacture and sell advanced electric vehicle powertrain components to other\nautomotive manufacturers. We have provided development services and full powertrain systems and components to Daimler for its Smart fortwo, A-\nClass, and B-Class electric vehicles and to Toyota for use in its RAV4 EV. We are continuing to supply production parts for the Daimler B class electric\nvehicle. Technology\nWe believe the core competencies of our company are powertrain engineering, vehicle engineering and innovative manufacturing. Our core\nintellectual property is contained within our electric powertrain and the ability to design a vehicle which capitalizes on the uniqueness of an electric\npowertrain. Our electric powertrain consists of the following: battery pack, power electronics, motor, gearbox and the control software which enables\nthe components to operate as a system. We designed each of these major elements for our Tesla Roadster and Model S and plan to use much of this\ntechnology in Model X, Model 3, our future electric vehicles and powertrain components that we build for other manufacturers. Our powertrain and\nbattery pack have a modular design, enabling future generations of electric vehicles and our stationary storage applications to incorporate a significant\namount of this technology. Further, our powertrain is very compact and contains far fewer moving parts than the internal combustion powertrain. These\nfeatures enable us to adapt it for a variety of applications, including our future vehicles and any powertrain components we build for other\nmanufacturers. Battery Pack\nWe design our battery packs to achieve high energy density at a low cost while also maintaining safety, reliability and long life. For example, we\nhave designed our Model S battery packs to store 85 kilowatt hours of useful energy and offer a warranty of unlimited miles over eight years. Our\nproprietary technology includes cooling systems, safety systems, charge balancing systems, battery engineering for vibration and environmental\ndurability, robotic manufacturing processes, customized motor design and the software and electronics management systems necessary to manage\nbattery and vehicle performance under demanding real-life driving conditions. We have significant experience and expertise in the safety and\nmanagement systems needed to work with lithium-ion cells in the demanding automotive environment. We believe these advancements have enabled us\nto produce a battery pack at a low cost per kilowatt-hour. 6\n\n \nWe have designed our battery pack system to permit flexibility with respect to battery cell chemistry, form factor and vendor. In so doing, we\nbelieve that we can leverage the substantial battery cell investments and advancements being made globally by battery cell manufacturers and\nourselves to continue to improve the cost per kilowatt-hour of our battery pack. We maintain an internal battery cell testing lab and an extensive\nperformance database of the many available lithium-ion cell vendors and chemistry types. We intend to incorporate the battery cells that provide the\nbest value and performance possible into our battery packs, and we expect this to continue over time as battery cells continue to improve in energy\nstorage capacity, longevity, power delivery and cost. We believe this flexibility will enable us to continue to evaluate new battery cells as they become\ncommercially viable, and thereby optimize battery pack system performance and cost for our current and future vehicles. In addition, we are designing\nthe cell manufacturing equipment for the Tesla Gigafactory to enable flexibility in terms of battery chemistry and form factor. We believe our ability to\nchange battery cell chemistries and vendors while retaining our existing investments in software, electronics, manufacturing equipment, testing and\nvehicle packaging, will enable us to quickly deploy various battery cells into our products and leverage the latest advancements in battery cell\ntechnology. The range of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines principally as a function of usage, time and charging patterns. Customers\u2019 use of\ntheir Tesla vehicle as well as the frequency with which they charge the battery of their Tesla vehicle can result in additional deterioration of the\nbattery\u2019s ability to hold a charge. For example, we currently expect that the Tesla Roadster battery pack will retain approximately 70% of its ability to\nhold its initial charge after approximately 100,000 miles or seven years, which will result in a decrease to the vehicle\u2019s initial range. In comparison with\nthe Roadster battery pack, preliminary internal testing and customer results of Model S to date suggest that the retention rate of the Model S battery\npack is greater, due to improvements at the battery cell and pack level. In addition, based on internal testing, we estimate that the Model S would have\nan approximate 5-10% reduction in range when operated continuously in 0\u00b0C temperatures. To date, we have tested hundreds of battery cells of different chemistries, form factors and designs. Based on this evaluation, we are presently\nusing lithium-ion battery cells based on the 18650 form factor in all of our battery packs. We intend to use the same battery cell form factor in Model X\nand entered into a supply agreement with Panasonic Corporation (Panasonic) for the use of Panasonic\u2019s battery cells in Model S and Model X. We\nexpect these battery cells to exhibit better performance and longer lifetimes than the battery cells used in the Tesla Roadster. Power Electronics\nThe power electronics in our electric powertrain govern the flow of electrical current throughout the car, primarily the current that flows into\nand out of the battery pack. The power electronics have two primary functions, the control of torque generation in the motor while driving and the\ncontrol of energy delivery back into the battery pack while charging. The first function is accomplished through the drive inverter, which converts direct current (DC) from the battery pack into alternating current\n(AC) to drive our three-phase induction motors. The drive inverter also converts the AC generated by regenerative braking back into DC for electrical\nstorage in the battery pack. The drive inverter performs this function by using a high-performance digital signal processor which runs some of the most\ncomplicated and detailed software in the vehicle. In so doing, the drive inverter is directly responsible for the performance, high efficiency and overall\ndriving experience of the vehicle. The second function, charging the battery pack, is accomplished by the charger, which converts alternating current (usually from a wall outlet or\nother electricity source) into direct current that can be accepted by the battery. Tesla vehicles can recharge on a variety of AC electrical sources, from a\ncommon outlet to a high power circuit of up to 22kW, which provides faster recharging. Vehicles in both the United States and Europe come with the\nTesla Mobile Connector which enables charging from a variety of different outlets. In other markets, Tesla offers a Tesla Wall Connector that can be\nhardwired at a wide range of power levels to suit the electrical capabilities of the charging location. The most common home charging system uses a standard high power and Mobile Connector to charge overnight. On the road, customers can\nalso charge using our Supercharger network or at a variety of destinations that have deployed our charging equipment. In addition, Model S vehicles\ncan also charge at a variety of public charging stations around the world, either natively or through a suite of adapters. This flexibility in charging\nprovides customers with additional mobility, while also allowing them to conveniently charge the vehicle overnight at home. 7\n\n \nVehicle Control and Infotainment Software\nThe performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs require sophisticated control software. There are numerous\nprocessors in our vehicles to control these functions, and we write custom firmware for many of these processors. The flow of electricity between the\nbattery pack and the motor must be tightly controlled in order to deliver the performance and behavior expected in the vehicle. For example, software\nalgorithms enable the vehicle to mimic the \u201ccreep\u201d feeling which drivers expect from an internal combustion engine vehicle without having to apply\npressure on the accelerator. Similar algorithms control traction, vehicle stability and the sustained acceleration and regenerative braking of the vehicle. Software also is used extensively to monitor the charge state of each of the cells of the battery pack and to manage all of its safety systems. Drivers use\nthe information and control systems in our vehicles to optimize performance, customize vehicle behavior, manage charging modes and times and control\nall infotainment functions. We develop almost all of this software, including most of the user interfaces, internally. We are also developing expertise in\nvehicle autopilot systems, including road tracking, lane changing, automated parking, driver warning systems and automated braking functions. Vehicle Design and Engineering\nIn addition to the design, development and production of the powertrain, we have created significant in-house capabilities in the design and\nengineering of electric vehicles and electric vehicle components and systems. We design and engineer bodies, chassis, interiors, heating and cooling\nand low voltage electrical systems in house and to a lesser extent in conjunction with our suppliers. Our team has core competencies in computer aided\ndesign and crash test simulations which we expect to reduce the product development time of new models. Several traditional automotive subsystems required substantial redesign and custom optimization to integrate with the powertrain of an electric\nvehicle. For example, we redesigned the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system to integrate with the battery thermal management\nsystem and to operate without the energy generated from an internal combustion engine. We have developed expertise in integrating these components\nwith the high-voltage power source in the vehicle and in designing components that significantly reduce their load on the vehicle battery pack, thereby\nmaximizing the available range of the vehicle. Additionally, our team has expertise in lightweight materials, a very important characteristic for electric vehicles given the impact of mass on\nrange. Model S is built with a lightweight aluminum body and chassis which incorporates a variety of materials and production methods that help\noptimize the weight of the vehicle. Sales and Marketing\nCompany-Owned Stores and Galleries\nWe market and sell cars directly to consumers through an international network of company-owned stores and galleries. Our Tesla stores and\ngalleries are highly visible, premium outlets in major metropolitan markets, some of which combine retail sales and service. We have also found that\nopening a service center in a new geographic area can increase demand. As a result, we have complemented our store strategy with sales facilities and\npersonnel in service centers to more rapidly expand our retail footprint. We refer to these as \u201cService Plus\u201d locations. Including all of our sales, Service\nPlus and service facilities, we operated 159 locations around the world as of December 31, 2014. We believe that by owning our own sales and service network we can offer a compelling customer experience while achieving operating\nefficiencies and capturing sales and service revenues incumbent automobile manufacturers do not enjoy in the traditional franchised distribution and\nservice model. Our customers deal directly with our own Tesla-employed sales and service staff, creating what we believe is a differentiated buying\nexperience from the buying experience consumers have with franchised automobile dealers and service centers. We believe we will also be able to\nbetter control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand, and obtain rapid customer feedback. Further, we believe that by owning our sales network we will avoid the conflict of interest in the traditional dealership structure inherent to most\nincumbent automobile manufacturers where the sale of warranty parts and repairs by a dealer are a key source of revenue and profit for the dealer but\noften are an expense for the vehicle manufacturer. 8\n\n \nTesla Supercharger Network\nWe are building a network of up to 120 kW fast charging equipment, each called a Tesla Supercharger, throughout North America, Europe and\nAsia for fast charging of Model S and future Tesla vehicles. Our Supercharger network is a strategic corporate initiative designed to remove a barrier to\nthe broader adoption of electric vehicles caused by the perception of limited vehicle range and to provide free charging access to Tesla\u2019s existing\ncustomers. The Tesla Supercharger is an industrial grade, high speed charger designed to replenish 170 miles of range in the battery pack in as little\nas 30 minutes. Supercharger stations typically have between four to ten Superchargers and are strategically placed primarily along well-travelled\nhighways to allow Model S owners to enjoy long distance travel with convenient, minimal stops. We currently have 380 Supercharger stations open in\nNorth America, Europe, and Asia. Access to the Supercharger network is currently available free of charge to owners of Model S vehicles with the 85\nkWh battery pack options and when purchased as an upfront option for 60 kWh. We are planning to methodically expand the Supercharger network\nover the next few years in the United States, Europe and Asia. Destination Charging\nWe are working with a wide variety of locations, including hotels and popular destinations, to offer an additional charging option for our\ncustomers. These destination charging partners deploy our wall connectors and provide charging free of charge to Model S owners. Almost 1,000\nlocations in Asia and North America currently have 1,800 Tesla wall connectors installed. We plan to expand the Destination Charging program into\nEurope in Q2 of this year. Orders and Reservations\nWe typically carry a very limited inventory of our Model S vehicles at our Tesla stores.",
  "We may not be able to successfully develop new electric vehicles, address new market segments or develop a significantly broader customer\nbase. In 2012, we publicly revealed an early prototype of the Model X crossover as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the Model S\nplatform and are currently testing our Beta Model X vehicles. We have also announced our intent to develop Model 3 based on a smaller platform than\nthe Model S which we expect to produce at the Tesla Factory after the introduction of Model X. Model 3 is currently planned to be a lower cost, smaller\nsedan designed for the mass market. Therefore, we intend to manufacture Model 3 in significantly higher volumes than Model S and there can be no\nassurance we can successfully scale our business accordingly. In addition, we have not yet finalized the design, engineering or component sourcing\nplans for Model 3 and there are no assurances that we will be able to bring this vehicle to market at the price point and in the volume that we currently\nintend, if at all. The market for vehicles in the price range we expect for Model 3 is much more competitive than for Model S and Model X, and therefore\nmargins are likely to be lower compared to Model S and Model X margins. Our efforts to manufacture and sell a sufficiently profitable Model 3 may not\nbe as successful, and therefore our business, prospects and operating results may suffer. Our failure to address additional market opportunities would\nharm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. The automotive market is highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in this industry. We currently face\ncompetition from new and established competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future. The worldwide automotive market, particularly for alternative fuel vehicles, is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more\nso in the future. Other automobile manufacturers entered the electric vehicle market at the end of 2010 and we expect additional competitors to enter\nthis market. With respect to Model S, we face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive premium\nsedan market, including Audi, BMW, Lexus and Mercedes. Many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market. BMW,\nDaimler, Nissan, Fiat, Ford and Mitsubishi, among others, have electric vehicles available today. Moreover, Porsche, Lexus, Audi, Volkswagen and Volvo\nare also developing electric vehicles. In addition, several manufacturers, including General Motors, Toyota, Ford, and Honda, are each selling hybrid\nvehicles, and certain of these manufacturers have announced plug-in versions of their hybrid vehicles. For example, in December 2010, General Motors\nintroduced the Chevrolet Volt, which is a plug-in hybrid vehicle that operates purely on electric power for a limited number of miles, at which time an\ninternal combustion engine engages to recharge the battery pack. Moreover, it has been reported that many of the other large OEMs, such as Daimler, Lexus and Audi, are also developing electric vehicles. Several new start-ups have also entered or announced plans to enter the market for performance electric vehicles. Finally, electric vehicles have\nalready been brought to market in China and other foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the United States market\nas well. Most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than\nwe do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their\nproducts. Virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do. In addition,\nalmost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do. Our competitors may be in a stronger position\nto respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design, develop, market and sell their products more effectively. Additionally, we have not in\nthe past, and do not currently, offer customary discounts on our vehicles like most of our competitors do. We expect competition in our industry to intensify in the future in light of increased demand for alternative fuel vehicles, continuing globalization\nand consolidation in the worldwide automotive industry. Factors affecting competition include product quality and features, innovation and development\ntime, pricing, reliability, safety, fuel economy, customer service and financing terms. Increased competition may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and\nincreased inventory, which may result in a further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and\nprospects. Our ability to successfully compete in our industry will be fundamental to our future success in existing and new markets and our market\nshare. There can be no assurances that we will be able to compete successfully in our markets. If our competitors introduce new cars or services that\ncompete with or surpass the quality, price or performance of our cars or services, we may be unable to satisfy existing customers or attract new\ncustomers at the prices and levels that would allow us to generate attractive rates of return on our investment. Increased competition could result in\nprice reductions and revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and\noperating results. 26\n\n \nDemand in the automobile industry is volatile, which may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and adversely affect our operating results. Volatility of demand in the automobile industry may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial\ncondition. The markets in which we currently compete and plan to compete in the future have been subject to considerable volatility in demand in\nrecent periods. Demand for automobile sales depends to a large extent on general, economic, political and social conditions in a given market and the\nintroduction of new vehicles and technologies. As a low volume producer, we have less financial resources than more established automobile\nmanufacturers to withstand changes in the market and disruptions in demand. As our business grows, economic conditions and trends in other\ncountries and regions where we currently or will sell our electric vehicles, such as Europe and Asia, will impact our business, prospects and operating\nresults as well. Demand for our electric vehicles may also be affected by factors directly impacting automobile price or the cost of purchasing and\noperating automobiles, such as sales and financing incentives, prices of raw materials and parts and components, cost of fuel and governmental\nregulations, including tariffs, import regulation and other taxes. Volatility in demand may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory,\nwhich may result in further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. These\neffects may have a more pronounced impact on our business given our relatively smaller scale and financial resources as compared to many incumbent\nautomobile manufacturers. If we are unable to establish and maintain confidence in our long-term business prospects among consumers, analysts and within our\nindustry, then our financial condition, operating results, business prospects and stock price may suffer materially. Our vehicles are highly technical products that require maintenance and support. If we were to cease or cut back operations, even years from\nnow, buyers of our vehicles from years earlier might have much more difficulty in maintaining their vehicles and obtaining satisfactory support. As a\nresult, consumers may be less likely to purchase our vehicles now if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our operations will\ncontinue for many years. Similarly, suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships\nwith us if they are not convinced that our business will succeed. If we are required to curtail our expansion plans in the future as we have done in the\npast, this may result in negative perceptions regarding our long-term business prospects and may lead to cancellations of Model S or Model X orders\nand reservations. Accordingly, in order to build and maintain our business, we must maintain confidence among customers, suppliers, analysts and other parties in\nour liquidity and long-term business prospects. In contrast to some more established automakers, we believe that, in our case, the task of maintaining\nsuch confidence may be particularly complicated by factors such as the following:\n\u25cf\nour limited operating history;\n\u25cf\nunfamiliarity with or uncertainty about Model X and future Tesla vehicles;\n\u25cf\nuncertainty about the long-term marketplace acceptance of alternative fuel vehicles generally, or electric vehicles specifically;\n\u25cf\nthe perceived prospect that we will need ongoing infusions of external capital to fund our planned operations;\n\u25cf\nthe size of our expansion plans in comparison to our existing capital base and scope and history of operations; and\n\u25cf\nthe prospect or actual emergence of direct, sustained competitive pressure from more established automakers, which may be more likely\nif our initial efforts are perceived to be commercially successful. Many of these factors are largely outside our control, and any negative perceptions about our long-term business prospects, even if exaggerated\nor unfounded, would likely harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds when needed. We have limited experience servicing our vehicles, especially in certain regions outside of the United States, and we are using a\ndifferent service model from the one typically used in the industry. If we are unable to address the service requirements of our\nexisting and future customers, our business will be materially and adversely affected. If we are unable to successfully address the service requirements of our existing and future customers and meet customer expectations\nregarding service, our business and prospects will be materially and adversely affected. We have limited experience servicing our vehicles, especially in\nEurope and Asia. Servicing electric vehicles is different than servicing vehicles with internal combustion engines and requires specialized skills,\nincluding high voltage training and servicing techniques. If we are unable to satisfactorily service our customers and the various service related issues\nthat they are facing and may face in the future, our ability to generate customer loyalty, grow our business and sell additional vehicles could be\nimpaired. 27\n\n \nWe service our performance electric vehicles through our company-owned Tesla service centers, certain of our stores, and through our mobile\nservice technicians known as the Tesla Rangers. However, certain service centers have been open for short periods, such as those outside of the United\nStates, and to date we have only limited experience servicing our performance vehicles at these locations. We will need to open new standalone service\ncenters in locations around the world and hire and train significant numbers of new employees to staff these service centers and act as Tesla Rangers in\norder to successfully maintain our fleet of delivered performance electric vehicles. We only implemented our Tesla Rangers program in October 2009\nand have limited experience in deploying them to service our customers\u2019 vehicles. There can be no assurance that these service arrangements or our\nlimited experience servicing our vehicles will adequately address the service requirements of our customers to their satisfaction, or that we will have\nsufficient resources to meet these service requirements in a timely manner as the volume of vehicles we are able to deliver annually increases. We do not expect to be able to open Tesla service centers in all the geographic areas in which our existing and potential customers may reside. In order to address the service needs of customers who are not in geographical proximity to our service centers, we plan to either transport those\nvehicles to the nearest Tesla store or service center for servicing or deploy our mobile Tesla Rangers to service the vehicles at the customer\u2019s location. These special arrangements may be expensive and we may not be able to recoup the costs of providing these services to our customers.",
  "Although none of our employees are currently represented by a labor union, it is common throughout the automobile industry generally for many\nemployees at automobile companies to belong to a union, which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages. Our\nemployees may join or seek recognition to form a labor union, or we may be required to become a union signatory. Our automobile production facility in\nFremont, California was purchased from NUMMI. Prior employees of NUMMI were union members and our future work force at this facility may be\ninclined to vote in favor of forming a labor union. We also own and operate another component manufacturing facility in Lathrop,\nCalifornia. Furthermore, we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as parts suppliers and trucking and\nfreight companies, and work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or\noperating results. If a work stoppage occurs, it could delay the manufacture and sale of our performance electric vehicles and have a material adverse\neffect on our business, prospects, operating results or financial condition. The mere fact that our labor force could be unionized may harm our\nreputation in the eyes of some investors and thereby negatively affect our stock price. Consequently, the unionization of our labor force could negatively\nimpact the company\u2019s health. 32\n\n \nWe are subject to substantial regulation, which is evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations\ncould substantially harm our business and operating results. The production and sale of motor vehicles, in general and specifically related to electric vehicles, are subject to substantial regulation under\ninternational, federal, state, and local laws. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant costs in complying with these regulations. Regulations related to the electric vehicle industry and alternative energy are currently evolving and we face risks associated with changes to\nthese regulations. In the United States, the following are examples of regulatory and statutory issues facing us:\n\u25cf\nthe imposition of a carbon tax or the introduction of a cap-and-trade system on electric utilities could increase the cost of electricity;\n\u25cf\nincreasingly stringent Clean Air Act emission regulations affecting power plants used to generate electricity could increase the cost of\nelectricity;\n\u25cf\nchanges to the regulations governing the assembly and transportation of lithium-ion battery packs, such as the UN Recommendations of\nthe Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods Model Regulations or regulations adopted by the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety\nAdministration (PHMSA) could increase the cost of lithium-ion battery packs or restrict their transport;\n\u25cf\nthe amendment or rescission of the federal law and regulations mandating increased fuel economy in the United States, referred to as the\nCorporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, could reduce new business opportunities for our powertrain sales and development\nactivities;\n\u25cf\nthe amendment or rescission of federal greenhouse gas tailpipe emission regulations administered by EPA under the authority of the Clean\nAir Act could reduce new business opportunities for our powertrain sales and development activities;\n\u25cf\nthe amendment or rescission of California\u2019s zero emission vehicle  (ZEV) regulations administered by the California Air Resources Board\nunder the California Health & Safety Code could reduce new business opportunities for our powertrain sales and development activities,\nas well as our ability to monetize ZEV credits not only in California, but also in the eleven additional states that have adopted the\nCalifornia program;\n\u25cf\nincreased sensitivity by regulators to the needs of established automobile manufacturers with large employment bases, high fixed costs\nand business models based on the internal combustion engine could lead them to pass regulations that could reduce the compliance costs\nof such established manufacturers or mitigate the effects of government efforts to promote alternative fuel vehicles;\n\u25cf\nchanges to the vehicle-specific Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, which govern how all motor vehicles are made within the United\nStates, could result in costly changes to how current vehicles are produced; and\n\u25cf\nchanges to regulations governing the export of our products could increase our delivery costs to outside the United States or force us to\ncharge consumers in such jurisdictions a higher price for our vehicles. In addition, as the automotive industry moves towards greater use of electronics in vehicle systems, NHTSA and other regulatory bodies may\nregulate these electronic systems more stringently, particularly as concerns about distracted driving increase.",
  "In addition, from time to\ntime, third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us in the form of letters and other forms of communication. If an\nunfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial\nposition and brand. 89\n\n \nIn November 2013, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed against Tesla in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California,\nalleging violations of, and seeking remedies pursuant to, Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The\ncomplaint, made claims against Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, sought damages and attorney\u2019s fees on the basis of allegations that, among other things,\nTesla and Mr. Musk made false and/or misleading representations and omissions, including with respect to the safety of Model S. This case was brought\non behalf of a putative class consisting of certain persons who purchased Tesla\u2019s securities between August 19, 2013 and November 17, 2013. On\nSeptember 26, 2014, the trial court, upon the motion of Tesla and Mr. Musk, dismissed the complaint with prejudice, and indicated that a formal written\norder will be forthcoming. Following the trial court\u2019s decision, Tesla and Mr. Musk brought a motion for sanctions against the plaintiffs, and that motion\nis currently pending. The plaintiffs have also appealed from the trial court\u2019s order, and that appeal is pending, as well.",
  "Failure of this component may have resulted in collapse of the rear seat back during a crash. Finally, in January 2014, we\nimplemented a firmware update to address issues with certain Universal Mobile Connector NEMA 14-50 adapters, which are part of the charging units\nand are not part of the vehicles themselves, potentially overheating during charging. In the future, we may at various times, voluntarily or involuntarily,\ninitiate a recall if any of our vehicles, including Model S, or our electric powertrain components prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable\nfederal motor vehicle safety standards. Such recalls, voluntary or involuntary, involve significant expense and diversion of management attention and\nother resources, and could adversely affect our brand image in our target markets, as well as our business, prospects, financial condition and results of\noperations. Our current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims which could adversely affect our\nfinancial performance. If our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our vehicles, our business, prospects, financial condition and\noperating results could be materially and adversely affected. Warranty reserves include management\u2019s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or\nto replace items under warranty. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to-date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of\nfuture claims.",

  "We are continuing our plan to build a number of additional service centers in several markets worldwide. Model S is designed with the capability to wirelessly upload the data to us via an on-board GSM system, allowing us to diagnose and remedy\nmany problems before ever looking at the vehicle. When maintenance or service is required, a customer can schedule service by contacting one of our\nTesla service centers. Our Tesla Rangers, or mobile service team, can also perform an array of services that do not require a vehicle lift from the\nconvenience of a customer\u2019s home or other remote location. 9\n\n \nWe believe that our company-owned service centers enable our technicians to work closely with our engineers and research and development\nteams in Silicon Valley to identify problems, find solutions, and incorporate improvements faster than incumbent automobile manufacturers. New Vehicle Limited Warranty, Maintenance and Extended Service Plans\nFor our Model S customers, we provide a four year or 50,000 mile New Vehicle Limited Warranty with every Model S, subject to separate limited\nwarranties for the supplemental restraint system and battery. During the third quarter of 2014, we extended the warranty on our Model S drive unit to\neight years from four. The New Vehicle Limited Warranty also covers the battery for a period of eight years or 125,000 miles or unlimited miles,\ndepending on the size of the vehicle\u2019s battery, although the battery\u2019s charging capacity is not covered. In addition to the New Vehicle Limited Warranty, we offer a comprehensive maintenance program for Model S, which includes plans covering\nmaintenance for up to eight years or up to 100,000 miles and an Extended Service Plan. The maintenance plans cover annual inspections, 24 hour\nroadside assistance and the replacement of wear and tear parts, excluding tires and the battery, with either a fixed fee per visit for Tesla Ranger service\nor unlimited Tesla Ranger visits for a higher initial purchase price. The Extended Service Plan covers the repair or replacement of Model S parts for an\nadditional four years or up to an additional 50,000 miles after the New Vehicle Limited Warranty. For our Roadster customers, we provided a three year or 36,000 mile New Vehicle Limited Warranty with every Tesla Roadster, which we\nextended to four years or 50,000 miles for the purchasers of our 2008 Tesla Roadster. Customers have the opportunity to purchase an Extended Service\nPlan for the period after the end of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty to cover the repair or replacement of Roadster parts for up to an additional three\nyears or 36,000 miles, provided they are purchased within a specified period of time. We have previously provided our Tesla Roadster customers with a\nbattery replacement option to replace the battery in their vehicles at any time after the expiration of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty but before the\ntenth anniversary of the purchase date of their vehicles. Our New Vehicle Limited Warranties and Extended Service plans are subject to certain limitations, exclusions or separate warranties, including\ncertain wear items, such as tires, brake pads, paint and general appearance, and battery performance, and are intended to cover parts and labor to\nrepair defects in material or workmanship in the body, chassis, suspension, interior, electronic systems, battery, powertrain and brake system.

  "We believe the benefits we receive\nfrom distribution ownership will enable us to improve the speed of product development and improve the capital efficiency of our business. We are also\ncontinuing to build our network of Superchargers in the United States, Europe and Asia to provide properly equipped Model S vehicle owners as well as\nfuture Tesla vehicle owners with fast and free charging to enable convenient long distance travel. In addition to developing our own vehicles, we have developed and currently sell and service full electric powertrain systems and components to\nother automobile manufacturers.",
  "The eventual impact on our income\ntax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is\nmade. Results of Operations\nRevenues\nAutomotive Sales\nAutomotive sales, which include vehicle, options and related sales, and powertrain component and related sales, consisted of the following for\nthe periods presented (in thousands):\n \n \n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n \n \n2014\n  \n2013\n  \n2012\n \nVehicle, options and related sales\n $\n3,079,415  $\n1,952,684  $\n354,344 \nPowertrain component and related sales\n  \n113,308   \n45,102   \n31,355 \nTotal automotive sales\n $\n3,192,723  $\n1,997,786  $\n385,699 \n \nVehicle, options and related sales primarily represent revenues related to deliveries of Model S, including vehicle options, accessories and\ndestination charges, vehicle service and sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Powertrain component and related sales\nrepresent the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems, such as battery packs and drive units, to other manufacturers. Vehicle, options and related sales during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 were $3.08 billion, $1.95 billion, and $354 million. The significant increases in vehicle, options and related sales was primarily driven by the ramp in Model S deliveries, including the commencement of\ndeliveries to Europe in August 2013 and China in April 2014. Deliveries of Model S vehicles were 31,655 in 2014, 22,477 in 2013, and 2,636 in 2012\nfollowing the commencement of our Model S deliveries in June 2012. The increase also resulted from higher sales of regulatory credits year-over-year.",
  "In addition, a\nnumber of potential customers may choose not to purchase our vehicles because of the lack of a more widespread service network. If we do not\nadequately address our customers\u2019 service needs, our brand and reputation will be adversely affected, which in turn, could have a material and adverse\nimpact on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. Traditional automobile manufacturers in the United States do not provide maintenance and repair services directly. Consumers must rather\nservice their vehicles through franchised dealerships or through third party maintenance service providers. We do not have any such arrangements with\nthird party service providers and it is unclear when or even whether such third party service providers will be able to acquire the expertise to service\nour vehicles. At this point, we anticipate that we will be providing substantially all of the service for our vehicles for the foreseeable future. As our\nvehicles are placed in more locations, we may encounter negative reactions from our consumers who are frustrated that they cannot use local service\nstations to the same extent as they have with their conventional automobiles and this frustration may result in negative publicity and reduced sales,\nthereby harming our business and prospects. In addition, the motor vehicle industry laws in many states require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles physically sold from\nlocations in the state. Whether these laws would also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to\nconsumers in a state in which we have no physical presence is uncertain. While we believe our Tesla Ranger program and our practice of transporting\ncustomers\u2019 vehicles to our nearest Tesla service center would satisfy regulators in these circumstances, without seeking formal regulatory guidance,\nthere are no assurances that regulators will not attempt to require that we provide physical service facilities in their states. Further, certain state\nfranchise laws which prohibit manufacturers from being licensed as a dealer or acting in the capacity of dealer also restrict manufacturers from\nproviding vehicle service. If issues arise in connection with these laws, certain aspects of Tesla\u2019s service program would need to be restructured to\ncomply with state law, which may harm our business. We may not succeed in maintaining and strengthening the Tesla brand, which would materially and adversely affect customer\nacceptance of our vehicles and components and our business, revenues and prospects. Our business and prospects are heavily dependent on our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand. Any failure to develop,\nmaintain and strengthen our brand may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell the Model S, Model X, Model 3 and other future planned\nelectric vehicles, and sell our electric powertrain components. If we do not continue to establish, maintain and strengthen our brand, we may lose the\nopportunity to build a critical mass of customers. Promoting and positioning our brand will likely depend significantly on our ability to provide high\nquality electric cars and maintenance and repair services, and we have very limited experience in these areas. Any problems associated with the Toyota\nRAV4 EV and Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV, both of which use a Tesla powertrain, or the Model X may hurt the Tesla brand. In addition, we expect that our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand will also depend heavily on the success of our\nmarketing efforts. To date, we have limited experience with marketing activities as we have relied primarily on the internet, word of mouth and\nattendance at industry trade shows to promote our brand. To further promote our brand, we may be required to change our marketing practices, which\ncould result in substantially increased advertising expenses, including the need to use traditional media such as television, radio and print. The\nautomobile industry is intensely competitive, and we may not be successful in building, maintaining and strengthening our brand. Many of our current\nand potential competitors, particularly automobile manufacturers headquartered in Detroit, Japan and the European Union, have greater name\nrecognition, broader customer relationships and substantially greater marketing resources than we do. If we do not develop and maintain a strong\nbrand, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely impacted. 28\n\n \nIf our vehicle owners customize our vehicles or change the charging infrastructure with aftermarket products, the vehicle may not\noperate properly, which could harm our business. Automobile enthusiasts may seek to \u201chack\u201d our vehicles to modify its performance which could compromise vehicle safety systems. Also, we are\naware of customers who have customized their vehicles with after-market parts that may compromise driver safety. For example, some customers have\ninstalled seats that elevate the driver such that airbag and other safety systems could be compromised. Other customers have changed wheels and tires,\nwhile others have installed large speaker systems that may impact the electrical systems of the vehicle. We have not tested, nor do we endorse, such\nchanges or products. In addition, customer use of improper external cabling or unsafe charging outlets can expose our customers to injury from high\nvoltage electricity. Such unauthorized modifications could reduce the safety of our vehicles and any injuries resulting from such modifications could\nresult in adverse publicity which would negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our plan to expand our network of Tesla stores, service centers and Superchargers will require significant cash investments and\nmanagement resources and may not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales of our electric vehicles. In addition, we\nmay not be able to open stores or service centers in certain states or Superchargers in desired locations. Our plan to expand our network of Tesla stores, service centers and Superchargers will require significant cash investments and management\nresources and may not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales of our electric vehicles. This ongoing global expansion may not have the\ndesired effect of increasing sales and expanding our brand presence to the degree we are anticipating. Furthermore, there can be no assurances that\nwe will be able to expand on the budget or timeline we have established. We will also need to ensure we are in compliance with any regulatory\nrequirements applicable to the sale and service of our vehicles in those jurisdictions, which could take considerable time and expense. If we experience\nany delays in expanding our network of Tesla stores, service centers and Superchargers, this could lead to a decrease in sales of our vehicles and could\nnegatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We have opened Tesla stores and service centers in major\nmetropolitan areas throughout North America, Europe and Asia, and we plan to open additional stores and service centers worldwide to support our\nongoing worldwide Model S rollout. We have also rapidly expanded our Supercharger network in the U.S., Europe and China. However, we may not be\nable to expand at a sufficient rate and our planned expansion will require significant cash investment and management resources, as well as efficiency\nin the execution of establishing these locations and in hiring and training the necessary employees to effectively sell and service our vehicles. Furthermore, certain states and foreign jurisdictions may have permit requirements, franchise dealer laws or similar laws or regulations that\nmay preclude or restrict our ability to open stores or sell vehicles out of such states and jurisdictions. Any such prohibition or restriction may lead to\ndecreased sales in such jurisdictions, which could harm our business, prospects and operating results. See Risk Factor \u201cWe may face regulatory\nlimitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly or over the internet which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric\nvehicles.\u201d Additionally, we may face potential difficulties in finding suitable Supercharger sites in desired locations, negotiating leases or obtaining\nrequired permits for such locations. We face risks associated with our international operations and expansion, including unfavorable regulatory, political, tax and labor\nconditions and establishing ourselves in new markets, all of which could harm our business. We face various risks associated with our international operations and expansion. We currently have international operations and subsidiaries in\nvarious countries and jurisdictions in Europe and Asia that are subject to the legal, political, regulatory and social requirements and economic\nconditions in these jurisdictions. Additionally, as part of our growth strategy, we will continue to expand our sales, maintenance, repair and\nSupercharger services internationally, particularly in China. However, we have limited experience to date selling and servicing our vehicles\ninternationally, as well as limited experience installing and operating Superchargers internationally, and international expansion requires us to make\nsignificant expenditures, including the establishment of local operating entities, hiring of local employees and establishing facilities in advance of\ngenerating any revenue. We are subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs, impact our\nability to sell our electric vehicles and require significant management attention. These risks include:\n\u25cf\nconforming our vehicles to various international regulatory and safety requirements where our vehicles are sold, or homologation;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty in establishing, staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties attracting customers in new jurisdictions;\n\u25cf\nforeign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements, including foreign taxes that we may not be able to offset against taxes\nimposed upon us in the United States, and foreign tax and other laws limiting our ability to repatriate funds to the United States;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including risks related to any interest rate swap or other hedging\nactivities we undertake;\n29\n\n \n\u25cf\nour ability to enforce our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect\nintellectual property rights to the same extent as do the United States, Japan and European countries, which increases the risk of\nunauthorized, and uncompensated, use of our technology;\n\u25cf\nUnited States and foreign government trade restrictions, customs regulations, tariffs and price or exchange controls;\n\u25cf\nforeign labor laws, regulations and restrictions;\n\u25cf\npreferences of foreign nations for domestically produced vehicles;\n\u25cf\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships;\n\u25cf\npolitical instability, natural disasters, war or events of terrorism; and\n\u25cf\nthe strength of international economies. Additionally, as we have expanded into new international markets, we have faced challenges with ensuring that our charging equipment works\nsuccessfully with the charging infrastructure in such markets. For example, we have encountered such challenges in Norway and China. If customers\nexperience problems with the way our charging equipment works with the local charging infrastructure, or we are unable to adapt our equipment to\nresolve such problems, then the viability and acceptance of our vehicles in such markets could be materially and adversely affected. If we fail to successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed. Developments in alternative technologies or improvements in the internal combustion engine may materially adversely affect the\ndemand for our electric vehicles. Significant developments in alternative technologies, such as advanced diesel, ethanol, hydrogen, fuel cells or compressed natural gas, or\nimprovements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine, may materially and adversely affect our business and prospects in ways we do not\ncurrently anticipate. Any failure by us to develop new or enhanced technologies or processes, or to react to changes in existing technologies, could\nmaterially delay our development and introduction of new and enhanced electric vehicles, which could result in the loss of competitiveness of our\nvehicles, decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors. The unavailability, reduction or elimination of, or uncertainty regarding, government and economic incentives in the U.S. and abroad\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. Any reduction or elimination of government and economic incentives due to policy changes the reduced need for such incentives as the customer\nbase of our electric vehicles expands, fiscal tightening or other reasons may result in the diminished competitiveness of the alternative fuel vehicle\nindustry generally or our electric vehicles in particular. Such reduction or elimination of incentives could materially and adversely affect our growth as\nwell because our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results, as our growth depends, in part, on the availability and amounts of\ngovernment incentives. For example, we currently benefit from certain exemptions in the United States, such as the California state sales and use taxes. Similarly, government programs in Europe favor the purchase of electric vehicles, including through disincentives that discourage the use of gas-\npowered vehicles. In Norway, for example, the purchase of electric vehicles is not currently subject to import taxes, taxes on non-recurring vehicle fees,\nthe 25% value added tax or the purchase taxes that apply to the purchase of gas-powered vehicles. If such government programs are reduced or\neliminated, or the available benefits thereunder are exhausted earlier than anticipated, sales of all electric vehicles, including our Model S, could be\nadversely affected. In addition, customers in certain markets may delay taking delivery of their Tesla vehicles if they believe that certain electric vehicle\nincentives will be available at a later date, which may negatively affect our ability to achieve our planned delivery targets. Our strategic relationships with third parties, such as Panasonic, are subject to various risks which could adversely affect our\nbusiness and future prospects. Our strategic relationships third parties, such as Panasonic which supplies us with battery cells for use in Model S and Model X and is our\npartner in the Gigafactory, pose various risks to us, including potential loss of access to important technology and vehicle parts, potential loss of\nbusiness and adverse publicity. In addition, these third parties may not perform as expected under our agreements with them, such as with respect to\nvehicle parts quality of timeliness, and we may have disagreements or disputes with these third parties.",
  "These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience may cause material changes to our\nwarranty reserves in the future. Subject to separate limited warranties for the supplemental restraint system and battery, we provide a four year or\n50,000 mile New Vehicle Limited Warranty for the purchasers of Model S. The New Vehicle Limited Warranty for Model S also covers the drive unit for\neight years and the battery for a period of eight years or 125,000 miles or unlimited miles, depending on the size of the vehicle\u2019s battery; although the\nbattery\u2019s charging capacity is not covered under the New Vehicle Limited Warranty or any Extended Service plan. In addition, customers have the opportunity to purchase an Extended Service plan for the period after the end of the New Vehicle Limited\nWarranty for Model S to cover additional services for an additional four years or 50,000 miles, provided it is purchased within a specified period of time. The New Vehicle Limited Warranty and Extended Service plans for the Tesla Roadster and Model S are subject to certain limitations, exclusions or\nseparate warranties, including certain wear items, such as tires, brake pads, paint and general appearance, and battery performance, and is intended to\ncover parts and labor to repair defects in material or workmanship in the vehicle including the body, chassis, suspension, interior, electronic systems,\npowertrain and brake system. We have previously provided our Tesla Roadster customers with a battery replacement option to replace the battery in\ntheir vehicles at any time after the expiration of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty but before the tenth anniversary of the purchase date of their\nvehicles. Additionally, in 2013, as part of our ongoing efforts to improve the customer ownership experience, we expanded the battery pack warranty\nand also eliminated the annual service requirement that was needed to keep the New Vehicle Limited Warranty in effect. Should this change in\nwarranty coverage lead to an increase in warranty claims, we may need to record additional warranty reserves which would negatively affect our\nprofitability. 34\n\n \nOur insurance strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks. We may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to losses resulting from products liability, accidents, acts of God and other claims against\nus, for which we may have no insurance coverage. While we currently maintain general liability, automobile, property, workers\u2019 compensation, and\ndirectors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance policies, as a general matter, we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do, and in\nsome cases, we do not maintain any at all. Additionally, the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles, and we cannot be certain that\nour insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future claims against us. A loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to\npay substantial amounts, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Our financial results may vary significantly from period-to-period due fluctuations in our operating costs and the seasonality of our\nbusiness. We expect our period-to-period operating results to vary based on our operating costs which we anticipate will increase significantly in future\nperiods as we, among other things, design, develop and manufacture Model X and future products, increase the production capacity at our\nmanufacturing facilities to produce vehicles at higher volumes, develop the Gigafactory, open new Tesla service centers with maintenance and repair\ncapabilities, open new Supercharger locations, increase our sales and marketing activities, and increase our general and administrative functions to\nsupport our growing operations. As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results, especially in the\nshort-term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance.",
  "If we cannot raise\nadditional funds when we need or want them, our operations and prospects could be negatively affected. The design, manufacture, sale and servicing of automobiles is a capital intensive business. We expect that our principal sources of liquidity will\nprovide us adequate liquidity based on our current plans. However, until we are consistently generating positive free cash flows, if the costs for\ndeveloping and manufacturing Model X exceed our expectations or if we incur any significant unplanned expenses or embark on or accelerate new\nsignificant strategic investments, such as the Gigafactory, we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt\nsecurities or through obtaining credit from government or financial institutions. This capital will be necessary to fund our ongoing operations, continue\nresearch and development projects, including those for our planned Model X crossover and Model 3 vehicle, establish sales and service centers, build\nand deploy Superchargers and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce Model X. We cannot be certain that\nadditional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our financial\ncondition, results of operations, business and prospects could be materially adversely affected. If we fail to effectively manage the residual, financing and credit risks for our recently launched Model S leasing program, our\nbusiness may suffer. We recently introduced a leasing program in the United States and Canada through our captive finance company, Tesla Finance. The profitability\nof the leasing program depends on our ability to accurately project residual values, secure adequate financing and/or business partners to fund and\ngrow this program, and manage customer credit risk. If actual residual values of Model S vehicles are below our estimates, we may suffer lower\nprofitability or potentially have losses. If we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program with either internal funds or external financing sources,\nwe may be unable to grow our sales. Additionally, if we do not properly screen customers for ability to pay their leases on time, we may be exposed to\nexcessive credit risks and associated losses. Furthermore, if our leasing business grows substantially, our business may suffer if we cannot effectively\nmanage the greater levels of residual and credit risks resulting from growth. Finally, if we do not successfully monitor and comply with federal and state\nfinancial regulations and consumer protection laws governing lease transactions, we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties, either of\nwhich may harm our business. Any failure to execute on the Daimler B-Class EV program could hurt our reputation as well as our profitability on this program. We have worked with Daimler to develop a full electric powertrain for a Daimler Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV vehicle. We have substantially\ncompleted our development services under this B-Class program and commenced production of electric powertrains and battery packs for Daimler. The\nsupply agreement for these products contemplates customary obligations of us such as timely deliveries, warranty and product defect obligations. If we\nfail to meet these obligations, or if we exceed our current cost projections for producing these products, our profitability on this program will suffer and\nthis could have a negative impact on our operating results. We may face regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly or over the internet which could materially and adversely\naffect our ability to sell our electric vehicles. We sell our vehicles from our Tesla stores as well as over the internet. We may not be able to sell our vehicles through this sales model in each\nstate in the United States as many states have laws that may be interpreted to prohibit internet sales by manufacturers to residents of the state or to\nimpose other limitations on this sales model, including laws that prohibit manufacturers from selling vehicles directly to consumers without the use of\nan independent dealership or without a physical presence in the state. In certain states in which we are not able to obtain dealer licenses, we have\nworked with state regulators to open galleries, which are locations where potential customers can view our vehicles but are not full retail locations. It is\npossible that a state regulator could later determine that the activities at our gallery constitute unlicensed sales of motor vehicles. In many states, the application of state motor vehicle laws to our specific sales model is largely untested under state motor vehicle industry laws\nand is being determined by a fact specific analysis of numerous factors, including whether we have a physical presence or employees in the applicable\nstate, whether we advertise or conduct other activities in the applicable state, how the sale transaction is structured, the volume of sales into the state,\nand whether the state in question prohibits manufacturers from acting as dealers. As a result of the fact specific and largely untested nature of these\nissues, and the fact that applying these laws intended for the traditional automobile distribution model to our sales model allows for some interpretation\nand discretion by the regulators, the manner in which the applicable authorities are applying their state laws to our distribution model continues to be\ndifficult to predict. Laws in some states have limited our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators and may continue to do so. 36\n\n \nIn addition, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles may be subject to challenges as to whether such decisions comply with\napplicable state motor vehicle industry laws. For example, vehicle dealer associations in New York, Ohio and Massachusetts have filed lawsuits to\nrevoke dealer licenses issued to us. These lawsuits have been dismissed, and in one recent court decision, the Supreme Court of Massachusetts held\nthat state franchise laws like the one in Massachusetts do not restrict a manufacturer, like Tesla, that does not use franchised dealers from selling its\nvehicles directly to consumers. Such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state laws were not designed to prevent our distribution model. Similar lawsuits have been filed in Georgia and Missouri. Possible additional challenges in other states, if successful, could restrict or prohibit our\nability to sell our vehicles to residents in such states. In some states, there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by vehicle dealer\nassociations to propose bills and regulations that, if enacted, would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales\nmodel. Such events recently occurred in New Jersey, where the Motor Vehicle Commission, at the behest of the local automobile dealer lobby, passed a\nnew regulation which purported to invalidate our sales licenses in the state, and in Michigan, where the state\u2019s automobile dealer association managed\nto add language into an unrelated bill that had the effect of impairing our right to sell vehicles through Tesla stores in Michigan. We have brought a\nlawsuit in New Jersey to invalidate that regulation, which we believe to be unlawful, and we are evaluating legislative and litigation solutions to remedy\nthe situation in Michigan. Other states, such as New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania, have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate, but at the\nsame time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate. We are also registered as both a motor vehicle manufacturer and dealer in Canada, Australia, and Japan, and have obtained licenses to sell\nvehicles in other places such as Hong Kong and China. Furthermore, while we have performed an analysis of the principal laws in the European Union\nrelating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws, we have not performed a complete analysis in all foreign jurisdictions in which\nwe may sell vehicles. Accordingly, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered\nthat may restrict our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to\ninterpret and may change over time. We may need to defend ourselves against patent or trademark infringement claims, which may be time-consuming and would cause us\nto incur substantial costs. Companies, organizations or individuals, including our competitors, may hold or obtain patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights that\nwould prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, develop, sell or market our vehicles or components, which could make it more difficult for\nus to operate our business. From time to time, we may receive communications from holders of patents or trademarks regarding their proprietary\nrights. Companies holding patents or other intellectual property rights may bring suits alleging infringement of such rights or otherwise assert their\nrights and urge us to take licenses. In addition, if we are determined to have infringed upon a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may be\nrequired to do one or more of the following:\n\u25cf\ncease selling, incorporating or using vehicles or offering goods or services that incorporate or use the challenged intellectual property;\n\u25cf\npay substantial damages;\n\u25cf\nobtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at\nall;\n\u25cf\nredesign our vehicles or other goods or services; or\n\u25cf\nestablish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to obtain a license to the infringed technology or other\nintellectual property right, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, any\nlitigation or claims, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. We may also face claims that our use of technology licensed or otherwise obtained from a third party infringes the rights of others. In such cases,\nwe may seek indemnification from our licensors/suppliers under our contracts with them. However, indemnification may be unavailable or insufficient to\ncover our costs and losses, depending on our use of the technology, whether we choose to retain control over conduct of the litigation, and other\nfactors. 37\n\n \nOur patent applications may not result in issued patents, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to prevent others\nfrom interfering with our commercialization of our products. The status of patents involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth and effectiveness of patented claims is uncertain. We cannot\nbe certain that we are the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or the first to file patent applications on these inventions,\nnor can we be certain that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents or that any of our issued patents will afford sufficient protection\nagainst someone creating a knockoff of our products, or as a defense against a competitor who claims that we are infringing its patents. In addition,\npatent applications filed in foreign countries are subject to laws, rules and procedures that differ from those of the United States, and thus we cannot be\ncertain that foreign patent applications related to issued U.S. patents will result in issued patents in those foreign jurisdictions. In addition, others may\nobtain patents that we need to license or design around, either of which would increase costs and may adversely affect our business, prospects,\nfinancial condition and operating results. Our trademark applications in certain countries remain subject to outstanding opposition proceedings. We currently sell and market our products and services in various countries under our Tesla marks. We have filed trademark applications for our\nTesla marks and opposition proceedings to trademark applications of third parties in various countries in which we currently sell and plan to sell our\nproducts and services. Certain of our trademark applications are subject to outstanding opposition proceedings brought by owners or applicants\nalleging prior applications for or use of similar marks. If we cannot resolve these oppositions and thereby secure registered rights in these countries,\nour ability to challenge third party users of the Tesla marks will be reduced and the value of the marks representing our exclusive brand name in these\ncountries will be diluted. In addition, there is a risk that the prior rights owners could in the future take actions to challenge our use of the Tesla marks\nin these countries. Such actions could have a severe impact on our position in these countries and may inhibit our ability to use the Tesla marks in these\ncountries. If we were prevented from using the Tesla marks in any or all of these countries, we would need to expend significant additional financial and\nmarketing resources on establishing an alternative brand identity in these markets. Our facilities or operations could be damaged or adversely affected as a result of disasters or unpredictable events. Our corporate headquarters in Palo Alto, Tesla Factory in Fremont and additional component manufacturing facilities in Lathrop are located in\nNorthern California, a region known for seismic activity. If major disasters such as earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, wars, terrorist attacks,\ncomputer viruses, pandemics or other events occur, or our information system or communications network breaks down or operates improperly, our\nheadquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged, or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products. In addition,\nour lease for our Palo Alto facility permits the landlord to terminate the lease following a casualty event if the needed repairs are in excess of certain\nthresholds and we do not agree to pay for any uninsured amounts. We may incur expenses relating to such damages, which could have a material\nadverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.",
  "Also, projections of any evaluation\nof effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.",
  "2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tesla and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions\nand balances have been eliminated in consolidation. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we began separately presenting the effect of exchange rate changes on our cash and cash\nequivalents in our consolidated statements of cash flows due to our growing operations in foreign currency environments. Prior period amounts have\nbeen reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the\ndate of the financial statements, and reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period, including revenue recognition, residual value of\noperating lease vehicles, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of financial instruments, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, uncertain tax\npositions, and stock-based compensation. Given the inherent uncertainty of these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting update which amends the existing accounting standards for\nrevenue recognition. The new guidance provides a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. Under the new model, revenue is\nrecognized as goods or services are delivered in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to collect. The guidance is effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2016; early adoption is prohibited. The new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting\nperiod presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application. We have not yet\nselected a transition method and are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenues from sales of Model S and the Tesla Roadster, including vehicle options and accessories, vehicle service and sales of\nregulatory credits, such as zero emission vehicle (ZEV),greenhouse gas emission (GHG) credits, and CAFE credits, as well as sales of electric vehicle\npowertrain components and systems, such as battery packs and drive units and sales of services related to the development of these systems. We\nrecognize revenue when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer\nacceptance; (iii) fees are fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection is reasonably assured.",

  "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n \n1. Overview of the Company\nTesla Motors, Inc. (Tesla, we, us or our) was incorporated in the state of Delaware on July 1, 2003. We design, develop, manufacture and sell\nhigh-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We have wholly-owned subsidiaries in North America,\nEurope and Asia. The primary purpose of these subsidiaries is to market, manufacture, sell and/or service our vehicles.",
  "The occurrence of any of the foregoing could\nadversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. 30\n\n \nThe operation of our vehicles is different from internal combustion engine vehicles and our customers may experience difficulty\noperating them properly, including difficulty transitioning between different methods of braking. We have designed our vehicles to minimize inconvenience and inadvertent driver damage to the powertrain. In certain instances, these\nprotections may cause the vehicle to behave in ways that are unfamiliar to drivers of internal combustion vehicles. For example, we employ\nregenerative braking to recharge the battery pack in most modes of vehicle operation. Our customers may become accustomed to using this\nregenerative braking instead of the wheel brakes to slow the vehicle. However, when the vehicle is at maximum charge, the regenerative braking is not\nneeded and is not employed by the vehicle. Accordingly, our customers may have difficulty shifting between different methods of braking. In addition,\nwe use safety mechanisms to limit motor torque when the powertrain system reaches elevated temperatures. In such instances, the vehicle\u2019s\nacceleration and speed will decrease. Finally, if the driver permits the battery pack to substantially deplete its charge, the vehicle will progressively\nlimit motor torque and speed to preserve the charge that remains. The vehicle will lose speed and ultimately coast to a stop. Despite several warnings\nabout an imminent loss of charge, the ultimate loss of speed may be unexpected. There can be no assurance that our customers will operate the vehicles properly, especially in these situations. Any accidents resulting from such\nfailure to operate our vehicles properly could harm our brand and reputation, result in adverse publicity and product liability claims, and have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. In addition, if consumers dislike these features, they may\nchoose not to buy additional cars from us, which could also harm our business and prospects. If we are unable to keep up with advances in electric vehicle technology, we may suffer a decline in our competitive position. We may be unable to keep up with changes in electric vehicle technology and, as a result, may suffer a decline in our competitive position. Any\nfailure to keep up with advances in electric vehicle technology would result in a decline in our competitive position which would materially and\nadversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. Our research and development efforts may not be sufficient to adapt\nto changes in electric vehicle technology. As technologies change, we plan to upgrade or adapt our vehicles and introduce new models in order to\ncontinue to provide vehicles with the latest technology, in particular battery cell technology. However, our vehicles may not compete effectively with\nalternative vehicles if we are not able to source and integrate the latest technology into our vehicles. For example, we do not currently manufacture\nbattery cells, which makes us dependent upon other suppliers of battery cell technology for our battery packs. If we are unable to attract and/or retain key employees and hire qualified management, technical, vehicle engineering and\nmanufacturing personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed and our stock price may decline. The loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations, delay the development and introduction of our vehicles and\nservices, and negatively impact our business, prospects and operating results as well as cause our stock price to decline. In particular, we are highly\ndependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, Product Architect and Chairman of our Board of Directors, and JB Straubel, our\nChief Technical Officer. None of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term. There can be no assurance that we will\nbe able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business. Our future success depends upon our ability to attract and\nretain our executive officers and other key technology, sales, marketing, engineering, manufacturing and support personnel and any failure to do so\ncould adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We have in the past and may in the future experience\ndifficulty in retaining members of our senior management team as well as technical, vehicle engineering and manufacturing personnel due to various\nfactors, such as a very competitive labor market for talented individuals with automotive experience. In addition, we do not have \u201ckey person\u201d life\ninsurance policies covering any of our officers or other key employees. Currently in Northern California, there is increasing competition for talented individuals with the specialized knowledge of electric vehicles,\nsoftware engineers, manufacturing engineers and other skilled employees and this competition affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire\nnew ones. Our continued success depends upon our continued ability to hire new employees in a timely manner and retain current employees. Additionally, we compete with many mature and prosperous companies in Northern California that have far greater financial resources than we do and\nthus can offer current or perspective employees more lucrative incentive packages than we can. Any difficulties in retaining current employees or\nrecruiting new ones would have an adverse effect on our performance. We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer. We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, Product Architect, Chairman of our Board of Directors and\nlargest stockholder. Although Mr. Musk spends significant time with Tesla and is highly active in our management, he does not devote his full time and\nattention to Tesla. Mr. Musk also currently serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technical Officer of Space Exploration Technologies, a developer\nand manufacturer of space launch vehicles, and Chairman of SolarCity, a solar equipment installation company. 31\n\n \nWe are subject to various environmental and safety laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and negatively\nimpact our ability to operate our manufacturing facilities.",
  "If our suppliers fail to use ethical business practices and comply with applicable laws and regulations, our brand image could be\nharmed due to negative publicity. Our core values, which include developing the highest quality electric vehicles while operating with integrity, are an important component of our\nbrand image, which makes our reputation particularly sensitive to allegations of unethical business practices. We do not control our independent\nsuppliers or their business practices. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee their compliance with ethical business practices, such as environmental\nresponsibility, fair wage practices, appropriate sourcing of raw materials, and compliance with child labor laws, among others. A lack of demonstrated\ncompliance could lead us to seek alternative suppliers, which could increase our costs and result in delayed delivery of our products, product shortages\nor other disruptions of our operations. Violation of labor or other laws by our suppliers or the divergence of an independent supplier\u2019s labor or other practices from those generally\naccepted as ethical in the United States or other markets in which we do business could also attract negative publicity for us and our brand. This could\ndiminish the value of our brand image and reduce demand for our performance electric vehicles if, as a result of such violation, we were to attract\nnegative publicity.",

  "The range and power of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines principally as a function of usage, time and charging patterns as well as\nother factors. How a customer uses their Tesla vehicle, the frequency of recharging the battery pack at a low state of charge and the means of charging\ncan result in additional deterioration of the battery pack\u2019s ability to hold a charge over the long term. For example, we currently expect that our battery\npack for the Tesla Roadster will retain approximately 70% of its ability to hold its initial charge after approximately 100,000 miles or seven years, which\nwill result in a decrease to the vehicle\u2019s initial range and power. Preliminary internal testing and customer results of Model S to date suggest that\ndeterioration of the Model S battery pack to be less than the Roadster, however, such battery pack deterioration and the related decrease in range and\npower over time as well as any perceived deterioration or fluctuation in range may negatively influence potential customer decisions whether to\npurchase our vehicles, which may harm our ability to market and sell our vehicles. 35\n\n \nWe may need or want to raise additional funds and these funds may not be available to us when we need them.",
  "Inventories and Inventory Valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out\nbasis. We record inventory write-downs based on reviews for excess and obsolescence determined primarily by future demand forecasts. We also adjust\nthe carrying value of our inventories when we believe that the net realizable value is less than the carrying value. These write-downs are measured as\nthe difference between the cost of the inventory, including estimated costs to complete, and estimated selling prices. Once inventory is written down, a\nnew, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in\nthat newly established cost basis. Property, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line\nmethod over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows:\n \nMachinery, equipment and office furniture\n 3 to 12 years\nBuilding and building improvements\n 30 years\nComputer equipment and software\n 3 years\n \nDepreciation for tooling is computed using the units-of-production method whereby capitalized costs are amortized over the total estimated\nproductive life of the related assets. As of December 31, 2014, the estimated productive life for tooling was 200,000 vehicles based on our current\nestimates of production. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the term of the related lease. Upon the retirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance\nsheet and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations. Maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred, while major\nimprovements that increase functionality of the asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably to expense over the identified useful life. Land is not\ndepreciated. Interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of significant capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on\nconstruction in progress is included in property, plant and equipment, and is amortized over the life of the related assets. Operating Lease Vehicles\nVehicles delivered under our resale value guarantee program, vehicles that are leased as part of our leasing program as well as any vehicles that\nare sold with a significant buy-back guarantee are classified as operating lease vehicles as the related revenue transactions are treated as operating\nleases. Operating lease vehicles are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the\nexpected operating lease term. The total cost of operating lease vehicles recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2014 and 2013\nwas $849.8 million and $401.9 million. Accumulated depreciation related to leased vehicles as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $83.1 million and\n$19.5 million. Long-lived Assets\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances\nindicate the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. Impairment exists if the carrying amounts of such assets exceed the\nestimates of future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such assets. Should impairment exist, the impairment loss would be\nmeasured based on the excess carrying value of the asset over the asset\u2019s estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we did not record\nany material impairment losses on our long-lived assets. Research and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll, benefits and stock-\nbased compensation of those employees engaged in research, design and development activities, costs related to design tools, license expenses related\nto intellectual property, supplies and services, depreciation and other occupancy costs. 72\n\n \nAdvertising and Promotion Costs\nAdvertising and sales promotion costs are expensed as incurred. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, advertising,\npromotion and related marketing expenses were $48.9 million, $9.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively. Shipping and Handling Costs\nAmounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and related shipping and handling costs are included in\ncost of revenues. Income Taxes\nIncome taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the\ndifference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences\nare expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be\nrealized. We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is\nmore likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense. Stock-based Compensation\nWe recognize compensation expense for costs related to all share-based payments, including stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and our\nemployee stock purchase plan (the ESPP). The fair value of stock options and the ESPP are estimated on the grant date and offering date using an\noption pricing model, respectively. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures. We account for equity instruments issued to non-employees based on the fair value of the awards. The fair value of the awards granted to non-\nemployees is re-measured as the awards vest and the resulting change in fair value, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations\nduring the period the related services are rendered. For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of\nindividual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable. For performance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions, the stock-\nbased compensation expense is recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of\nthe performance and market conditions, beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of being met (see\nNote 8). Foreign Currency Remeasurement and Transactions\nFor each of our foreign subsidiaries, the functional currency is the U.S.",
  "Tesla is responsible for the first $15\nmillion of remediation costs and any costs in excess of $30 million or costs incurred after the ten-year anniversary of closing. NUMMI is responsible for\nremediation costs between $15 million and $30 million for up to 10 years from the closing date. Through December 31, 2014, we have paid $3.1 million\nfor remediation costs incurred related to the Fremont facility. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we accrued a total of $4.0 million and $5.5 million\nrelated to these environmental liabilities. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings that arise from the normal course of business activities.",
  "The \u201csimplified\u201d method, as permitted by the SEC, is calculated as the average of the\ntime-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. Our expected volatility is derived from our implied volatility on publicly traded options of our common stock and the historical volatilities of\nseveral unrelated public companies within industries related to our business, including the automotive OEM, automotive retail, automotive parts and\nbattery technology industries, because we have limited trading history on our common stock. When making the selections of our peer companies within\nindustries related to our business to be used in the volatility calculation, we also considered the stage of development, size and financial leverage of\npotential comparable companies.",
  "Beginning in the first quarter of 2015, we will change the caption of this to be Services and Other Revenue. This will include other revenues\nrelated to powertrain component sales to Daimler and other OEMs, vehicle service and sales from used Model S cars. Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit\nCost of revenues includes cost of automotive sales and costs related to our development services. Cost of automotive sales for the year ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 were $2.31 billion, $1.54 billion, and $371.7 million. Cost of\nautomotive sales includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including amortized tooling costs, royalty fees, shipping and\nlogistic costs and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales also includes adjustments to warranty expense, charges to write\ndown the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess\nof forecasted demand and charges related to write down of fixed assets no longer in use for the production of Model S or our powertrain component\nsales. The increase in cost of automotive sales was driven primarily by the ramp in Model S deliveries. In the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 we recognized $66.1 million and $19.4 million, respectively, in cost of automotive sales related\nto vehicle depreciation for cars accounted for as operating leases. For cars accounted for as leases our warranty reserves do not include projected\nwarranty costs as such actual warranty costs are expensed as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, warranty costs incurred for\nour lease vehicles were $7.0 million and $1.6 million. Gross profit for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 were $881.7 million, $456.3 million and $30.1 million Gross margin for the\nyears ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 were 27.6%, 22.7%, and 7.3%. The increase in gross profit from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to\nmanufacturing and supply chain efficiencies as well as component cost reductions and higher regulatory credit sales, partially offset by one-time\nmanufacturing inefficiencies associated with transitioning to our new final assembly line and launch of All-Wheel Drive Dual Motor Model S. The\nincrease in gross profit from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to higher vehicle production volumes, cost reduction efforts including process efficiencies\nin manufacturing and supply chain, design improvements, as well as reduction of waste in the supply chain. Research and Development Expenses\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research, supply chain, quality,\nmanufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations, prototyping expense, contract and professional services and amortized equipment\nexpense. Overhead costs related to the Tesla Factory prior to the start of production of Model S are also included in R&D expenses. Also included in\nR&D expenses are development services costs that we incur, if any, prior to the finalization of agreements with our development services customers as\nreaching a final agreement and revenue recognition is not assured. Development services costs incurred after the finalization of an agreement are\nrecorded in cost of revenues. R&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $464.7 million, an increase from $232.0 million for the year ended December 31,\n2013. The increase in R&D expenses consisted primarily of an $85.3 million increase in employee compensation expenses, a $60.7 million increase in\nexpensed materials primarily to support our Model X, dual motor powertrain and right-hand drive Model S development, a $50.9 million increase in\ncosts related to Model X, dual motor powertrain and right-hand drive Model S engineering, design and testing activities, a $28.1 million increase in\nstock-based compensation expense related to increased headcount and increasing values of awards granted, a $4.1 million increase in office,\ninformation technology and facilities-related costs and a $3.3 million increase in shipping charges for Model X, dual motor powertrain and right-hand\ndrive Model S development. R&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 were $232.0 million, a decrease from $274.0 million for the year ended December 31,\n2012. R&D expenses decreased due to significant development, prototyping and testing expenses related to the Model S launch in 2012, partially offset\nby an increase in similar costs in 2013 for Model X and right-hand drive Model S and other programs. The $42.0 million decrease in R&D expenses\nduring the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted primarily of an $18.2 million decrease in expensed materials, an $8.5 million decrease in employee\ncompensation expenses, a $7.8 million decrease in costs related to Model S engineering, design and testing activities, a $6.6 million decrease in\nshipping charges for Model S prototype materials and a $4.9 million decrease in office, information technology and facilities-related costs. The decrease\nwas partially offset by a $5.0 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to a larger number of outstanding equity awards due to\nadditional headcount and generally an increasing common stock valuation applied to new grants. 54\n\n \nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses consist primarily of personnel and facilities costs related to our Tesla stores, marketing,\nsales, executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations, as well as litigation settlements and fees for professional\nand contract services. SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $603.7 million, an increase from $285.6 million for the year ended December 31,\n2013. SG&A expenses increased primarily from higher headcount and costs to support an expanded retail, service and Supercharger footprint as well as\nthe general growth of the business. The $318.1 million increase in our SG&A expenses consisted primarily of a $141.1 million increase in employee\ncompensation expenses related to higher sales and marketing headcount to support sales activities worldwide and higher general and administrative\nheadcount to support the expansion of the business, a $135.9 million increase in office, information technology and facilities-related costs to support the\ngrowth of our business as well as sales and marketing activities to handle our expanding market presence, a $35.8 million increase in stock-based\ncompensation expense related to additional headcount and  increasing value of awards granted and a $27.2 million increase in professional and outside\nservices costs. SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 were $285.6 million, an increase from $150.4 million for the year ended December 31,\n2012. SG&A expenses increased primarily from higher headcount and costs to support an expanded retail, service and Supercharger footprint as well as\nthe general growth of the business. The $135.2 million increase in our SG&A expenses during the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted primarily of\na $62.8 million increase in employee compensation expenses related to higher sales and marketing headcount to support sales activities worldwide and\nhigher general and administrative headcount to support the expansion of the business, a $36.8 million increase in office, information technology and\nfacilities-related costs to support the growth of our business as well as sales and marketing activities to handle our expanding market presence, a\n$17.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to additional headcount and  increasing value of awards granted and a $17.2\nmillion increase in professional and outside services costs. Interest Expense\nInterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 was $100.9 million, $32.9 million and $0.3 million. The increase in\ninterest expense from 2013 to 2014 was due to the issuance of $920.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes and $1.38 billion aggregate\nprincipal amount of 2021 Notes during the first half of 2014. The increase in interest expense from 2012 to 2013 was due to $17.8 million of interest\nexpense incurred upon repayment of the Department of Energy (DOE) loan in May 2013 for early repayment fees, accrued interest and the amortization\nof the remaining loan origination costs as well as interest associated with the $660.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2018 Notes issued in May\n2013. Other Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, consists primarily of the change in the fair value of our DOE common stock warrant liability and foreign exchange\ngains and losses related to our foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. We expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary\ndepending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates. Prior to the expiration of the DOE warrant in May 2013, the DOE warrant had been\ncarried at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair value reflected in other income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net, for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $1.8 million, $22.6 million and ($1.8) million. The other\nincome, net of $22.6 million in 2013 was primarily due to the reduction in fair value of our DOE common stock warrant liability of $10.7 million during\nthe year. In March 2013, we entered into a fourth amendment to the DOE Loan Facility which, among other things, accelerated the maturity date of our\nDOE loans to December 15, 2017; therefore, the DOE warrant was no longer expected to vest. The other income, net, also includes the favorable foreign\ncurrency exchange impact from our foreign currency-denominated liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2013, especially related to the\nJapanese yen. Provision for Income Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 was $9.4 million, $2.6 million, and $0.1 million. The\nincreases in the provision for income taxes were due primarily to the increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions, following the\ncommencement of European Model S deliveries in August 2013 and Model S deliveries in Asia in April 2014. 55\n\n \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $1.91 billion in principal sources of liquidity available from our cash and cash equivalents including $1.27\nbillion of money market funds. Amounts held in foreign currencies had a US dollar equivalent of $315 million as of December 31, 2014, and consisted\nprimarily of Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, euro and Norwegian krone. Sources of cash are predominately from our deliveries of Model S, as well as customer deposits for Model S and Model X, sales of regulatory\ncredits, cash from the provision of development services, and sales of powertrain components and systems. We expect that our current sources of\nliquidity, including cash and cash equivalents, together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities, will provide us with adequate\nliquidity over the next 12 months based on our current plans. These cash flows enable us to fund our ongoing operations, research and development\nprojects for our planned Model X, Model 3, and certain other future products; purchase tooling and manufacturing equipment required to introduce\nModel X and to continue to ramp up production of Model S; construct our Gigafactory; and establish and expand our stores, service centers and\nSupercharger network. We currently anticipate making aggregate capital expenditures of about $1.5 billion over the next 12 months.

  "We recently introduced Model S to China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Australia. Through December 31, 2014, a majority of our revenues have been denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we have materially greater revenues than\nexpenses denominated in the Chinese yuan and Norwegian krona, and materially greater expenses than revenues denominated in the Japanese yen. December 31, 2014.",
  "As we open additional Tesla stores and service centers, we secure dealer licenses (or\ntheir equivalent) and engage in sales activities to sell our vehicles directly to consumers. A few states, such as Texas and Michigan, do not permit\nautomobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer, or otherwise restrict a manufacturer\u2019s ability to deliver or\nservice vehicles. To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer, we must generally conduct the sale out of the state via the\ninternet, phone or mail. In such states, we have opened \u201cgalleries\u201d that serve an educational purpose and are not retail locations. As we expand our retail footprint in the United States, some automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our\noperations in court and used administrative and legislative processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to\nnew locations. Although we have thus far prevailed in every lawsuit brought by dealer associations, we expect that the dealer associations will continue\nto mount challenges to our business model. In addition, we expect the dealer associations to actively lobbying state Governors and legislators to\ninterpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to Tesla\u2019s ownership and operation of its own retail and service locations. While we have analyzed the principal laws in the US, EU, China, Japan, UK, and Australia relating to our distribution model and believe we\ncomply with such laws, we have not performed a complete analysis of all jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles. Accordingly, there may be laws in\ncertain jurisdictions that may restrict our sales and service operations. Competition\nThe worldwide automotive market, particularly for alternative fuel vehicles, is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more\nso in the future as we introduce additional, lower priced vehicles such as our Model 3. We believe the impact of new regulatory requirements for\noccupant safety and vehicle emissions, technological advances in powertrain and consumer electronics components, and shifting customer needs and\nexpectations are causing the industry to evolve in the direction of electric-based vehicles. We believe the primary competitive factors in our markets\ninclude but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\ntechnological innovation;\n\u25cf\nproduct quality and safety;\n\u25cf\nservice options;\n\u25cf\nproduct performance;\n\u25cf\ndesign and styling;\n\u25cf\nbrand perception;\n\u25cf\nproduct price; and\n\u25cf\nmanufacturing efficiency. We believe that our vehicles compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification as well as based on their propulsion\ntechnology. For example, Model S competes primarily in the extremely competitive premium sedan market with internal combustion vehicles from more\nestablished automobile manufacturers, including Audi, BMW, Lexus and Mercedes. Our vehicles also compete with vehicles propelled by alternative\nfuels, principally electricity. 14\n\n \nMany established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market. BMW,\nDaimler, Nissan, Fiat, Ford and Mitsubishi, among others, have electric vehicles available today. Moreover, Porsche, Lexus, Audi, Volkswagen and Volvo\nare also developing electric vehicles. Electric vehicles have also already been brought to market in China and other foreign countries and we expect a\nnumber of those manufacturers to enter the United States market as well. In addition, several manufacturers, including General Motors, Toyota, Ford,\nand Honda, are each selling hybrid vehicles, and certain of these manufacturers have announced plug-in versions of their hybrid vehicles. Most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, may be able to devote greater resources to the\nmanufacture, sale and support of their products, and have other advantages. We believe our exclusive focus on electric vehicles and electric vehicle\ncomponents, as well as our history of vehicle development and production, however, are the basis on which we can compete in the global automotive\nmarket in spite of the challenges posed by our competition. Intellectual Property\nAs part of our business, we seek to protect our intellectual property rights in various ways, including through trademarks, copyrights, trade\nsecrets, including know-how, patents, patent applications, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, intellectual property licenses and other\ncontractual rights. Additionally, consistent with our mission to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport, we announced a patent policy in which we\nirrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related\nequipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith. We made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common, rapidly-evolving\nplatform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting ourselves, other companies making electric vehicles, and the world. Segment Information\nWe have determined that we operate as one reportable segment, which is the design, development, manufacturing and sales of electric vehicles\nand electric powertrain components.

  "Financial Services\nWe offer loans and leases in North America, Europe and Asia primarily through various financial institutions. We also offer leases directly\nthrough our captive finance company in 37 states, the District of Columbia and in 4 provinces of Canada. Certain of our loan programs provide\ncustomers with a resale value guarantee under which those customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period of 36 to 39\nmonths following delivery for a pre-determined resale value. This structure allows the customer to enjoy the benefits of Model S ownership without\nconcern for its resale value. We introduced this program in North America in 2013 and expanded it to selected European markets in 2014. In certain\nmarkets, we also offer buy back guarantees to financial institutions which obligate us to repurchase, and the institution to sell us, the vehicles for a pre-\ndetermined price. We intend to broaden our financial services offerings during the next few years. Manufacturing\nWe conduct our powertrain and vehicle manufacturing and assembly operations at our facilities in Fremont, California; Lathrop, California; and\nTilburg, Netherlands. We are also building a cell and battery manufacturing facility, the Tesla Gigafactory, outside of Reno, Nevada. The Tesla Factory in Fremont, CA and Manufacturing in Lathrop, CA\nWe manufacture Model S and certain components that are critical to our intellectual property and quality standards for Model S at the Tesla\nFactory. The Tesla Factory contains several manufacturing operations, including stamping, machining, casting, plastics, body assembly, paint\noperations, final vehicle assembly and end-of-line testing. In addition, we manufacture lithium-ion battery packs, electric motors, gearboxes and\ncomponents both for our vehicles and for our original equipment manufacturer customers at the Tesla Factory. Several major component systems of our\nvehicles are purchased from suppliers; however we have a high level of vertical integration in our manufacturing processes at the Tesla Factory. We\nrecently commenced production and machining of various aluminum components at our facility in Lathrop, California. We continue to increase our production capacity at the Tesla Factory with the goal of producing Model S, Model X and Model 3 at this\nlocation. In 2015, we intend to create a new body shop line to prepare for the expanded production of both Model S and Model X. We are also finishing\nthe construction of a new high volume paint shop, to be used for Model S, Model X and Model 3. 10\n\n \nThe Netherlands\nOur European headquarters is located in Amsterdam, Netherlands and houses our sales, service, and administrative functions. We also have\noperations in Tilburg, Netherlands for final assembly, testing and quality control for vehicles ultimately delivered into the European Union.",
  "As a result, our operating results could be adversely affected. The introduction of our resale value guarantee and leasing programs may result in lower revenues and profits and exposes us to\nresale risk to the extent many customers elect to return their vehicles to us and the residual values are lower than our estimates. In 2013 we began offering a resale value guarantee to all customers who purchased a Model S in the United States and Canada and financed\ntheir vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners. In April and October of 2014, we started offering leasing to business customers\nand individual customers, respectively, including through Tesla Finance, our captive finance company. Both the resale value guarantee program and\nleasing offered through Tesla Finance generate lower revenues in the period the car is delivered as compared to cash purchases and both expose us to\nthe risk that any vehicles repurchased or returned to us under the programs may be resold by us for prices less than we estimate. Under the resale value guarantee program, Model S customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period of 36 to 39\nmonths following delivery for a pre-determined resale value. As a result of this resale value guarantee and customers having the option of selling their\nvehicles to us, we apply lease accounting to such purchases, which defers the recognition of the associated revenues over time instead of full\nrecognition at vehicle delivery. Although the resale value guarantee does not impact our cash flows and liquidity at the time of vehicle delivery, a\nsignificant uptake under this program could have a significant adverse impact on our near term GAAP revenues and operating results. Under the leasing program offered through Tesla Finance, we lease vehicles directly to customers. Customers have the option of purchasing\ntheir vehicles at the stated value in the leasing contract or returning their vehicles to us. We apply lease accounting to such purchases. Unlike the\nresale value guarantee program, we may receive only a very small portion of the price of the vehicle from our customers at the time of purchase, and\ninstead will receive a stream of lease payments. To the extent we expand this program and are unable to secure appropriate financing, our cash flow\nand liquidity, as well as our near term GAAP revenues and operating results, could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, we are exposed to credit risk\nthat customers may not pay their lease payments on time and according to the terms of our leasing contracts. Under both programs, we are exposed to the risk that the vehicles\u2019 resale value may be lower than our estimates and the volume of vehicles\nreturned to us may be higher than our estimates, which could impact our future cash flows and/or profitability. Currently, there is only a very limited\nsecondary market for our electric vehicles on which to base our estimates, and such a secondary market may not develop in the future. Our residual\nvalue and return volume estimates could prove to be incorrect, either of which could harm our financial condition and operating results. Increases in costs, disruption of supply or shortage of raw materials, in particular lithium-ion cells, could harm our business. We may experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of raw materials. Any such increase or supply\ninterruption could materially and negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We use various raw materials in\nour business including aluminum, steel, nickel and copper. The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global\ndemand for these materials and could adversely affect our business and operating results. For instance, we are exposed to multiple risks relating to\nlithium-ion cells. These risks include:\n\u25cf\nthe inability or unwillingness of current battery manufacturers to build or operate battery cell manufacturing plants to supply the numbers\nof lithium-ion cells required to support the growth of the electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle industry as demand for such cells increases;\n\u25cf\ndisruption in the supply of cells due to quality issues or recalls by battery cell manufacturers;\n\u25cf\nan increase in the cost of raw materials, such as nickel used in lithium-ion cells, or aluminum used in the body of Model S; and\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar as our battery cell purchases are currently denominated in Japanese\nyen. 23\n\n \nOur business is dependent on the continued supply of battery cells for our vehicles\u2019 battery packs as well as for the battery packs we produce for\nother automobile manufacturers. While we believe several sources of the battery cells are available for such battery packs, we have fully qualified only\none supplier for the cells used in such battery packs and have very limited flexibility in changing cell suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of battery\ncells from such vendors could disrupt production of our vehicles and of the battery packs we produce for other automobile manufacturers until such\ntime as a different supplier is fully qualified. Furthermore, fluctuations or shortages in petroleum and other economic conditions may cause us to\nexperience significant increases in freight charges and raw material costs. Substantial increases in the prices for our raw materials or prices charged to\nus, such as those charged by our battery cell manufacturers, would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the\nincreased costs through increased electric vehicle prices. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recoup increasing costs of raw materials by\nincreasing vehicle prices. Any attempts to increase vehicle prices in response to increased raw material costs could be viewed negatively by our\ncustomers, result in cancellations of vehicle orders and reservations and could materially and adversely affect our brand, image, business, prospects\nand operating results. Our success could be harmed by negative publicity regarding our company or our products, particularly Model S. Occasionally, third parties evaluate or publish stories regarding our vehicles. For example, in 2013 the New York Times published a negative\nreview of the Model S and our Supercharger network on a route from Washington, D.C. to Boston. The story created a negative public perception about\nModel S, its capabilities and the Supercharger network. To the extent that negative comments about us or our products are believed by the public, this\nmay cause current or potential customers not to purchase our electric vehicles, including Model S and Model X, which can materially and adversely\naffect our business, operating results, financial conditions and prospects. Our distribution model is different from the predominant current distribution model for automobile manufacturers, which makes\nevaluating our business, operating results and future prospects difficult. Our distribution model is not common in the automobile industry today, particularly in the United States. We plan to continue to sell our\nperformance electric vehicles in company-owned Tesla stores and over the internet. While we believe our approach is important to the success of our\ntechnology and vehicles, this model of vehicle distribution is relatively new and unproven, especially in the United States, and subjects us to substantial\nrisk as it requires, in the aggregate, a significant expenditure and provides for slower expansion of our distribution and sales systems than may be\npossible by utilizing a more traditional dealer franchise system. For example, we do not utilize long-established sales channels developed through a\nfranchise system to increase our sales volume, which may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Moreover, we\ncompete with companies with well-established distribution channels. We have opened Tesla stores in North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific Region, many of which have been open for only a short period of\ntime. We have relatively limited experience distributing and selling our performance vehicles through our Tesla stores, especially in Asia. Our success\nwill depend in large part on our ability to effectively develop our own sales channels and marketing strategies. Implementing our business model is\nsubject to numerous significant challenges, including obtaining permits and approvals from local and state authorities, and we may not be successful in\naddressing these challenges. The concept and layout of our interactive stores, which are typically located in high profile retail centers, is different than\nwhat has previously been used in automotive sales. We do not know whether our store strategy will continue to be successful. We may incur additional\ncosts in order to improve or change our retail strategy. Other aspects of our distribution model also differ from those used by traditional automobile manufacturers. For example, we do not anticipate\nthat we will ever carry a significant amount of vehicle inventory at our stores and customers may need to wait up to a few months from the time they\nplace an order until the time they receive their vehicle. This type of custom manufacturing is unusual in the premium sedan market in the United States\nand it is unproven whether the average customer will be willing to wait this amount of time for such a vehicle. If customers do not embrace this\nordering and retail experience, our business will be harmed. 24\n\n \nWe may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to\nsuccessfully defend or insure against such claims. We may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. The\nautomobile industry experiences significant product liability claims and we face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not\nperform as expected or malfunction resulting in personal injury or death. Our risks in this area are particularly pronounced given the limited number of\nvehicles delivered to date and limited field experience of those vehicles. A successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a\nsubstantial monetary award. Moreover, a product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our vehicles and business and\ninhibit or prevent commercialization of other future vehicle candidates which would have material adverse effect on our brand, business, prospects and\noperating results. We self-insure against the risk of product liability claims, meaning that any product liability claims will have to be paid from company\nfunds, not by insurance. Any lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial\ncondition. We may not be able to secure additional product liability insurance coverage on commercially acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when\nneeded, particularly if we do face liability for our products and are forced to make a claim under such a policy. We are currently expanding and improving our information technology systems. If these implementations are not successful, our\nbusiness and operations could be disrupted and our operating results could be harmed. We are currently expanding and improving our information technology systems, including implementing new internally developed systems, to\nassist us in the management of our business. In particular, our volume production of Model S necessitates continued development, maintenance and\nimprovement of our information technology systems in the U.S. and abroad, which include product data management, procurement, inventory\nmanagement, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management, financial, tax and regulatory compliance systems. These systems support our operations and enable us to produce Model S and future vehicles like Model X in volume. The implementation, maintenance\nand improvement of these systems require significant management time, support and cost. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with\ndeveloping, improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems, including the disruption of our data management,\nprocurement, manufacturing execution, finance, supply chain and sales and service processes. These risks may affect our ability to manage our data and\ninventory, procure parts or supplies or manufacture, sell, deliver and service vehicles, or achieve and maintain compliance with, or realize available\nbenefits under, tax laws and other applicable regulations. We cannot be sure that these expanded systems or their required functionality will be effectively implemented or sufficiently maintained. If we\ndo not successfully implement, improve or maintain these systems, our operations may be disrupted, our ability to accurately and/or timely report our\nfinancial results could be impaired; and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting, which may impact our ability to certify\nour financial results. If these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to, we may be required to expend significant resources to\nmake corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions. We may not realize the benefits of our Supercharger network, which could harm our business, brand and operating results. We continue to deploy Tesla Superchargers in the United States, Europe and Asia. Tesla Superchargers are a network of charging stations\ndesigned to provide fast-charge capability to owners of Model S vehicles with the Supercharging option. We intend to expand the Tesla Supercharger\nnetwork throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia, but we may be unable to do so due to a number of factors, including the inability to secure, or\ndelays in securing, suitable locations and permits, problems negotiating leases with landowners or obtaining required permits for such locations,\ndifficulties in interfacing with the infrastructures of various utility companies and greater than expected costs and difficulties of installing, maintaining\nand operating the network. We may also be unable to expand the Supercharger network as fast as we intend or as the public expects, or to place the charging stations in\nplaces our customers believe to be optimal. Furthermore, even where Superchargers exist, the increasing number of Model S vehicles as well as future\nvehicles such as Model X may oversaturate the available charging bays at such Superchargers, leading to increased wait times and dissatisfaction for\ncustomers. In addition, as we have announced that we will not be charging our customers to access this network in addition to what they have already\npaid for their vehicles, any significant unexpected costs that we encounter will entirely be borne by us and may harm our operating results. Although\nour Supercharger network is intended to address customer concerns regarding long-distance travel, this network may not result in increased\nreservations or sales of Model S or future vehicles like Model X. If our Supercharger network is not expanded as currently planned or as quickly as\nplanned, we may not realize the benefits of our Supercharger network and our business and operating results could be materially affected. 25\n\n \nIf we are unable to design, develop, market and sell new electric vehicles that address additional market opportunities, our business,\nprospects and operating results will suffer.",

  "Additionally, we amortized all remaining unamortized debt issuance costs related to the DOE Loan Facility. California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority Tax Incentives\nIn December 2009, we finalized an arrangement with the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority\n(CAEATFA) that resulted in an exemption from California state sales and use taxes for the purchase of $320 million of manufacturing equipment. As the\nequipment purchased would otherwise have been subject to California state sales and use tax, we believe this incentive resulted in tax savings by us of\napproximately $31 million over the period starting in December 2009 and ending in December 2013. The equipment purchases were used for three\npurposes: (i) to establish our production facility for Model S in California, (ii) to upgrade our Palo Alto powertrain production facility, and (iii) to expand\nour Tesla Roadster assembly operations at our Menlo Park facility. We exhausted all funds from the December 2009 approved exemption from\nCalifornia state sales and use taxes for $320 million of manufacturing equipment in December 2013. In January 2012, we finalized an additional agreement with CAEATFA for an exclusion from California state sales and use taxes for the purchase\nof up to $292 million of manufacturing equipment. To the extent all of this equipment is purchased and would otherwise be subject to California state\nsales or use tax, we believe this incentive would result in tax savings by us of up to approximately $24 million over the period starting in December\n2011 and ending in December 2015. The equipment purchased under this exclusion may only be used for two purposes: (i) to develop Model X and its\nproduction capacity in California and (ii) to further upgrade our powertrain production facilities in California. We have not yet exhausted the $292\nmillion in funds approved by CAEATFA in 2012. In December 2013, we finalized a third agreement with CAEATFA that will result in an exclusion from California state sales and use taxes for an\nadditional $415 million of manufacturing equipment. To the extent all of this equipment is purchased and would otherwise be subject to California state\nsales or use tax, we believe this 2013 incentive would result in tax savings by us of up to approximately $35 million over the period starting in\nDecember 2013 and ending in December 2016. The equipment purchased under this exclusion may only be used for three purposes: (i) to expand Model\nS manufacturing capacity in California; (ii) to expand electric vehicle powertrain production in California; and (iii) future Model S electric vehicle\ndevelopment. 12\n\n \nRegulatory Credits\nIn connection with the production, delivery, and placement into service of our zero emission vehicles in global markets, we have earned and will\ncontinue to earn various tradable regulatory credits that can be sold to other manufacturers. Under California\u2019s Zero-Emission Vehicle Regulations and those of states that have adopted the California standards, vehicle manufacturers are\nrequired to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in those states during each model year are zero-emission vehicles and partial zero-\nemission vehicles. Currently, the states of Arizona, California, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York,\nOregon, Rhode Island and Vermont have such laws in effect. These laws provide that a manufacturer may earn credits, referred to as ZEV credits, if\nthey produce more zero-emission vehicles than the minimum quantity required by those laws. Those manufacturers with a surplus of credits may sell\nthe excess credits to other manufacturers who can then apply such credits to comply with the regulatory requirements, including making up for deficits. As a manufacturer solely of zero-emission vehicles, we have no minimum requirement, and therefore earn ZEV credits on each vehicle delivered and\nplaced into service in such states. We have entered into agreements with other automobile manufacturers to sell the ZEV credits that we earn. Recently,\nCalifornia passed amendments to the ZEV mandate that would require, starting in 2018, all large-volume manufacturers (those manufacturers selling\n20,000 or more vehicles in California in 2018) to increase the number of zero emission vehicles sold, such that 15.4% of each manufacturers\u2019 fleet must\nbe made of zero emission vehicles by 2025. All states that have adopted the California program will amend their programs to conform to the new\nCalifornia standards. Additionally, under the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) national greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards and similar standards\nadopted by the Canadian government, car and truck manufacturers are required to meet fleet-wide average carbon dioxide emissions standards. Manufacturers who fail to meet such standards have a deficit in their emission profile. Manufacturers whose fleet wide average performs better than\nsuch standards may earn credits. Manufacturers may sell excess credits to other manufacturers, who can use the credits to comply with these\nregulatory requirements. As a manufacturer solely of zero emission vehicles, we earn the full amount of GHG credits established by the standards on\neach vehicle sold. We have contracted with another automobile manufacturer to sell all earned credits. Under the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s (NHTSA) Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, car and truck\nmanufacturers are required to meet fleet-wide average fuel economy standards. Manufacturers that fail to meet such standards have a deficit in their\nfuel economy profile. Manufacturers whose fleet-wide average performs better than such standards may earn credits. Manufacturers may sell excess\ncredits to other manufacturers, who can use such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements. We have entered into agreements to sell the\ncredits that we earn. Regulation\u2014Vehicle Safety and Testing\nOur vehicles are subject to, and comply with or are otherwise exempt from, numerous regulatory requirements established by NHTSA, including\nall applicable United States Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). The Model S fully complies with all FMVSSs without the need for any\nexemptions. The Roadster complies with or is exempt from all FMVSS. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSS, as well as the NHTSA bumper standard, or otherwise are\nexempt, before the vehicles can be imported or sold in the United States. Numerous FMVSS apply to our vehicles, such as crash-worthiness\nrequirements, crash avoidance requirements, and electric vehicle requirements. We are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by\nNHTSA, including the CAFE standards, Theft Prevention Act requirements, consumer information labeling requirements, Early Warning Reporting\nrequirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls, and owner\u2019s manual requirements. The Automobile Information and Disclosure Act requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the\nmanufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, the Act allows inclusion of city and highway fuel economy ratings, as\ndetermined by EPA, as well as crash test ratings as determined by NHTSA if such tests are conducted. Our vehicles sold in outside of the U.S. are subject to foreign safety testing regulations. Many of those regulations are different from the federal\nmotor vehicle safety standards applicable in the United States and may require redesign and/or retesting. Regulation\u2014EPA Emissions & Certificate of Conformity\nThe Clean Air Act requires that we obtain both an EPA-issued Certificate of Conformity and a California Air Resources Board (CARB)-issued\nExecutive Order with respect to emissions for our vehicles. The Certificate of Conformity is required for vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air\nAct\u2019s standards and both the Certificate of Conformity and the Executive Order are required for vehicles sold in states that have sought and received a\nwaiver from the EPA to utilize California standards. The California standards for emissions control for certain regulated pollutants for new vehicles and\nengines sold in California are set by CARB. States that have adopted the California standards as approved by EPA also recognize the Executive Order\nfor sales of vehicles. 13\n\n \nRegulation\u2014Battery Safety and Testing\nOur battery pack conforms to mandatory regulations that govern transport of \u201cdangerous goods\u201d, defined to include lithium-ion batteries, which\nmay present a risk in transportation. The governing regulations, issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), are\nbased on the United Nations (UN) Recommendations and Model Regulations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, as well as related UN Manual Tests\nand Criteria. The regulations vary by mode of shipping transportation, such as by ocean vessel, rail, truck, or air. We have completed the applicable\ntransportation tests for our prototype and production battery packs, demonstrating our compliance with the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria. We also\nsubject our battery packs to the appropriate tests specified in the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) J2464 and J2929 standards, which incorporate\ntests such as immersion, humidity, and exposure to fire. We use lithium metal oxide cells in our high voltage battery packs. The cells do not contain any lead, mercury, cadmium, other hazardous\nmaterials, heavy metals, or toxic materials. Our battery packs include certain packaging materials that contain trace amounts of hazardous chemicals\nwhose use, storage, and disposal is regulated under federal law. We currently have an agreement with a third party battery recycling company to\nrecycle our battery packs. If a customer wishes to dispose of a battery pack from one of our vehicles, we anticipate accepting the depleted battery from\nthe customer without any additional charge. Automobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation\nState laws regulate the manufacture, distribution, and sale of automobiles, and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be\nlicensed in order to sell vehicles directly to consumers in the state.",
  "We have a history of losses and have to deliver significant cost reductions to achieve sustained, long-term profitability and long-term\ncommercial success. We have had net losses on a GAAP basis in each quarter since our inception, except for the first quarter of 2013. Even if we are able to continue\nto increase Model S production and sales and begin to produce and sell Model X and future vehicles, there can be no assurance that we will be\nprofitable. In order to achieve profitability as well as long-term commercial success, we must continue to achieve our planned cost reductions, control\nour operational costs while producing quality vehicles, increase our production rate, maintain strong demand in North America, and grow demand\nabroad in Europe and Asia. Failure to do one or more of these things could prevent us from achieving sustained, long-term profitability. 22\n\n \nForeign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar could harm our financial results. Our revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies are not completely matched. As we have increased Model S deliveries in markets\noutside of the United States, we have much higher revenues than costs denominated in other currencies such as the euro, Norwegian kroner, and\nChinese yuan. The recent strengthening of the U.S.",
  "As an automobile manufacturer, we are subject to national, state, provincial and/or local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations,\nincluding laws relating to the use, handling, storage, disposal and human exposure to hazardous materials, both in the United States and abroad. Environmental and health and safety laws and regulations can be complex, and we expect that our business and operations will be affected by new, or\nfuture amendments to, such laws that may require us to change our operations, potentially resulting in a material adverse effect on our business. These\nlaws can give rise to liability for administrative oversight costs, cleanup costs, property damage, bodily injury and associated fines and penalties. Capital\nand operating expenses needed to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations can be significant, and violations of those laws\nmay result in substantial fines and penalties, third party damages, suspension of production or a cessation of our operations. These expenses could have\na material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results. Contamination at properties formerly owned or operated by us, as well as at properties we will own and operate, and properties to which\nhazardous substances were sent by us, may result in liability for us under environmental laws and regulations, including, but not limited to the\nComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). The government can impose liability on us under CERCLA for the\nfull amount of remediation-related costs of a contaminated site without regard to fault. Such costs can include those associated with the investigation\nand cleanup of contaminated soil, ground water and buildings as well as to reverse impacts to human health and damages to natural resources. We may also face unexpected delays in obtaining the necessary permits and approvals required by environmental laws in connection with our\nmanufacturing facilities that could require significant time and financial resources and negatively impact our ability to operate these facilities, which\nwould adversely impact our business prospects and operating results. As the owner of the Tesla Factory and surrounding land, we may be responsible\nunder federal and state laws and regulations for the entire investigation and remediation of any environmental contamination at the Tesla Factory,\nwhether it occurred before or after the date we purchased the property. When Tesla purchased the property, the previous owner and operator of the\nTesla Factory, New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI), identified environmental conditions at the Tesla Factory that could adversely affect soil\nand groundwater, and agreed to remediate these conditions. Although NUMMI stated that it fully documented and managed all environmental issues at\nthe Tesla Factory, we cannot determine with certainty the truth of this statement, nor the total costs to remediate any pre-existing contamination that\nmay eventually be found. We have reached an agreement with NUMMI under which, over a ten year period, we will pay the first $15.0 million of any\ncosts of any governmentally-required remediation activities for contamination that existed prior to the closing of the purchase for any known or\nunknown environmental conditions (Remediation Activities), and NUMMI has agreed to pay the next $15.0 million for such Remediation Activities. Our\nagreement provides, in part, that NUMMI will pay up to the first $15.0 million on our behalf if such expenses are incurred in the first four years of our\nagreement, subject to our reimbursement of such costs on the fourth anniversary date of the closing. On either the ten-year anniversary of the closing or whenever $30.0 million has been spent on Remediation Activities, whichever comes first,\nNUMMI\u2019s liability to us with respect to Remediation Activities ceases, and we are responsible for any and all environmental conditions at the Fremont\nsite. At that point in time, we have agreed to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless NUMMI from all liability, including attorney fees, or any costs or\npenalties it may incur arising out of or in connection with any claim relating to environmental conditions and we have released NUMMI for any known\nor unknown claims except for NUMMI\u2019s obligations for representations and warranties under the agreement. There are no assurances that NUMMI will perform its obligations under our agreement and NUMMI\u2019s failure to perform would require us to undertake\nthese obligations at a potentially significant cost. Such performance may also adversely affect the production capacity of, and our ability to operate, the Tesla\nFactory. Any Remediation Activities or other environmental conditions at the Fremont site could harm our operations and the future use and value of the Fremont\nsite and could delay our production plans for Model S. Our business may be adversely affected by union activities.",

  "treasury bills. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, our accounts receivable were derived primarily from sales of regulatory credits, as well as funds to be\nreceived from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products to our customers, the development and sales of\npowertrain components and systems to OEMs. Accounts receivable also included amounts to be received from commercial financial institutions for\napproved financing arrangements between our customers and financial institutions.

  "directly from Tesla Finance, our captive financing entity, as well as through a bank partner. Leasing\nthrough Tesla Finance is now available in 37 states, the District of Columbia and in 4 provinces of Canada. We leased approximately 1,150 vehicles\nthrough Tesla Finance during 2014 and about approximately 200 vehicles through our banking partner. Leasing through both Tesla Finance and our\nbanking partner exposes us to residual value risk and will adversely impact our near-term revenues and operating results by requiring the deferral of\nrevenues and costs into future periods under lease accounting. In addition, for leases offered directly from Tesla Finance (but not for those offered\nthrough our bank partner), we will not receive the full amount of the cash for the vehicle price at delivery and will assume customer credit risk. We\nexpect to increase our leasing activities during 2015. We have set the residual values given to our customers under our resale value guarantee program at what we estimate will be the trade-in value\nof these vehicles at the end of the term of the option. Based on current market demand for our cars, we estimate the resale prices for our vehicles will\ncontinue to be above our resale value guarantee amounts.",
  "We believe our vehicles deliver unparalleled driving experiences with\ninstantaneous and sustained acceleration through an extended range of speed. In addition, our Model S seats five adults, provides best in\nclass storage in the trunk and hood while offering design and performance comparable to, or better than, other premium sedans. We sell our vehicles through our own sales and service network which we are continuing to grow globally.",
  "Although the cost of this\nrecall was not material, and limited to a small number of total Model S\u2019s produced, we may experience additional recalls in the future, which could\nadversely affect our brand in our target markets, as well as our business, prospects and results of operations. In January 2014 we implemented a firmware update to address issues with certain Universal Mobile Connector NEMA 14-50 adapters, which are\npart of the charging units and are not part of the vehicles themselves, potentially overheating during charging. We further announced that we would\nprovide upgraded NEMA 14-50 adapters to our customers as an additional safeguard. If such measures do not adequately address the underlying\nconcerns, our business, prospects and results of operations could be harmed. Our electric vehicles may not perform consistent with customers\u2019 expectations or consistent with other vehicles currently available. For example,\nour electric vehicles may not have the durability or longevity of current vehicles, and may not be as easy to repair as other vehicles currently on the\nmarket. Additionally, while Model S recently achieved an overall five star safety rating by NHTSA, there is no guarantee that future model years or\nvariants or other Tesla vehicles will also attain such safety ratings, and any such rating is not a guarantee of safe product design or that any individual\nvehicle will be free of any defect or failure. Any product defects or any other failure of our performance electric vehicles to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in\nadverse publicity, lost revenue, delivery delays, product recalls, product liability claims, harm to our brand and reputation, and significant warranty and\nother expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. 18\n\n \nWe are dependent on our suppliers, the majority of which are single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to continue\nto deliver, or their refusal to deliver, necessary components of our vehicles in a timely manner at prices, quality levels, and volumes\nacceptable to us would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Model S contains numerous purchased parts which we source globally from over 300 direct suppliers, the majority of whom are currently single\nsource suppliers for these components. We expect that Model X will be sourced in an approximately similar manner. While we obtain components from\nmultiple sources whenever possible, similar to other automobile manufacturers, the majority of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by\nus from single sources. To date we have not qualified alternative sources for most of the single sourced components used in our vehicles and we do not\nmaintain long-term agreements with a number of our suppliers. While we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships and can obtain or engineer replacement components for our\nsingle source components, we may be unable to do so in the short term, or at all, at prices or costs that are favorable to us. In particular, while we\nbelieve that we will be able to secure alternate sources of supply for most of our single sourced components in a relatively short time frame, qualifying\nalternate suppliers or developing our own replacements for certain highly customized components of our vehicles may be time consuming, costly and\nmay force us to make additional modifications to a vehicle\u2019s design. This limited supply chain exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or component shortages for our vehicles, as well as for our\npowertrain component sales activities. For example, earthquakes similar to the one that occurred in Japan in March 2011 or labor issues such as work\nstoppages or strikes at the ports on the west coast could negatively impact our supply chain. We have in the past experienced source disruptions in our\nsupply chains, including those relating to our slower-than-anticipated ramp in our Model S production goals for 2012. We may experience additional\ndelays in the future with respect to Model S, Model X and any other future vehicle we may produce. In addition, because we have written agreements in place with the majority, but not all, of our suppliers, this may create uncertainty regarding a\nsupplier\u2019s obligations to us, including but not limited to, those regarding warranty and product liability. Changes in business conditions, wars,\ngovernmental changes and other factors beyond our control or which we do not presently anticipate, could also affect our suppliers\u2019 ability to deliver\ncomponents to us on a timely basis. Furthermore, if we experience significantly increased demand, or need to replace certain existing suppliers, there\ncan be no assurance that additional supplies of component parts will be available when required on terms that are favorable to us, at all, or that any\nsupplier would allocate sufficient supplies to us in order to meet our requirements or fill our orders in a timely manner. In the past, we have replaced\ncertain suppliers because of their failure to provide components that met our quality control standards. The loss of any single or limited source supplier\nor the disruption in the supply of components from these suppliers could lead to delays in vehicle deliveries to our customers, which could hurt our\nrelationships with our customers and also materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Changes in our supply chain have resulted in the past, and may result in the future, in increased cost and delay. We have also experienced cost\nincreases from certain of our suppliers in order to meet our quality targets and development timelines as well as due to design changes that we made,\nand we may experience similar cost increases in the future. Additionally, we are negotiating with existing suppliers for cost reductions, seeking new and\nless expensive suppliers for certain parts, and attempting to redesign certain parts to make them cheaper to produce. If we are unsuccessful in our\nefforts to control and reduce supplier costs, our operating results will suffer. Additionally, cost reduction efforts may interrupt or harm our normal\nproduction processes, thereby harming vehicle quality or reducing Model S production output. Furthermore, a failure by our suppliers to provide the components in a timely manner or at the level of quality necessary to manufacture our\nperformance electric vehicles could prevent us from fulfilling customer orders in a timely fashion which could result in negative publicity, damage our\nbrand and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Finally, in October 2013, we entered into an amendment to our existing supply agreement with Panasonic Corporation in order to address our\nanticipated short- to medium-term lithium-ion battery cell needs. While we expect that this supply agreement, as amended, will provide us with\nsufficient cells for the next few years, we may not be able to meet our long-term needs, including for Model 3 and other programs we may introduce,\nwithout securing additional suppliers or other sources for cells. We have recently signed an agreement with Panasonic to be our partner in the\nGigafactory and be responsible for, among other things, manufacturing cells from there for use in our products. If we encounter unexpected difficulties\nwith our current suppliers, including Panasonic, and if we are unable to fill these needs from other suppliers, we could experience production delays,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. 19\n\n \nOur future growth is dependent upon consumers\u2019 willingness to adopt electric vehicles. Our growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumers of, and we are subject to an elevated risk of any reduced demand for,\nalternative fuel vehicles in general and electric vehicles in particular. If the market for electric vehicles in North America, Europe and Asia does not\ndevelop as we expect, or develops more slowly than we expect, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be harmed. The\nmarket for alternative fuel vehicles is relatively new, rapidly evolving, characterized by rapidly changing technologies, price competition, additional\ncompetitors, evolving government regulation and industry standards, frequent new vehicle announcements and changing consumer demands and\nbehaviors. Other factors that may influence the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles, and specifically electric vehicles, include:\n\u25cf\nperceptions about electric vehicle quality, safety (in particular with respect to lithium-ion battery packs), design, performance and cost,\nespecially if adverse events or accidents occur that are linked to the quality or safety of electric vehicles, such as those related to the\nChevrolet Volt battery pack fires or incidents involving Model S;\n\u25cf\nperceptions about vehicle safety in general, in particular safety issues that may be attributed to the use of advanced technology, including\nvehicle electronics and regenerative braking systems;\n\u25cf\nnegative perceptions of electric vehicles, such as that they are more expensive than non-electric vehicles and are only affordable with\ngovernment subsidies;\n\u25cf\nthe limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge and the effects of weather on this range;\n\u25cf\nthe decline of an electric vehicle\u2019s range resulting from deterioration over time in the battery\u2019s ability to hold a charge;\n\u25cf\nvaried calculations for driving ranges achievable by EVs, which is inherently difficult given numerous factors affecting battery range;\n\u25cf\nconcerns about electric grid capacity and reliability, which could derail our past and present efforts to promote electric vehicles as a\npractical solution to vehicles which require gasoline;\n\u25cf\nconcerns by potential customers that if their battery pack is not charged properly, it may become unusable and may need to be replaced;\n\u25cf\nthe availability of alternative fuel vehicles, including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles;\n\u25cf\nimprovements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine;\n\u25cf\nthe availability of service for electric vehicles;\n\u25cf\nconsumers\u2019 desire and ability to purchase a luxury automobile or one that is perceived as exclusive;\n\u25cf\nthe environmental consciousness of consumers;\n\u25cf\nvolatility in the cost of oil and gasoline;\n\u25cf\nconsumers\u2019 perceptions of the dependency of the United States on oil from unstable or hostile countries;\n\u25cf\ngovernment regulations and economic incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of energy as well as tax and other\ngovernmental incentives to purchase and operate electric vehicles;\n\u25cf\naccess to charging facilities, standardization of electric vehicle charging systems and consumers\u2019 perceptions about convenience and cost\nto charge an electric vehicle; and\n\u25cf\nperceptions about and the actual cost of alternative fuel. In addition, reports have suggested the potential for extreme temperatures to affect the range or performance of electric vehicles, and based on\nour own internal testing, we estimate that our vehicles may experience a material reduction in range when operated in extremely cold temperatures. To\nthe extent customers have concerns about such reductions or third party reports which suggest reductions in range greater than our estimates gain\nwidespread acceptance, our ability to market and sell our vehicles, particularly in colder climates, may be adversely impacted. 20\n\n \nAdditionally, we will become subject to regulations that require us to alter the design of our vehicles, which could negatively impact consumer\ninterest in our vehicles. For example, our electric vehicles make less noise than internal combustion vehicles. Due to concerns about quiet vehicles and\nvision impaired pedestrians, in January 2011, Congress passed and the President signed the Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2010. The new law\nrequires NHTSA to establish minimum sounds for electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles when travelling at low speeds. NHTSA issued a notice of\nproposed rulemaking in 2013 and plans to finalize a rule as soon as sometime in 2015 with a potential effective date for implementation as early as\n2018. This will begin a three year phase-in schedule for establishing these minimum sounds in all electric and hybrid electric vehicles. Adding this\nartificial noise may cause current or potential customers not to purchase our electric vehicles, which would materially and adversely affect our business,\noperating results, financial condition and prospects. If we fail to manage future growth effectively as we rapidly grow our company, especially internationally, we may not be able to\nproduce, market, sell and service our vehicles successfully. Any failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial\ncondition. We continue to expand our operations significantly in North America as well as in Europe and Asia. Our future operating results depend to a\nlarge extent on our ability to manage this expansion and growth successfully. Risks that we face in undertaking this global expansion include:\n\u25cf\nfinding and training new personnel, especially in new markets such as Europe and Asia;\n\u25cf\ncontrolling expenses and investments in anticipation of expanded operations;\n\u25cf\nestablishing or expanding sales, service and Supercharger facilities in a timely manner;\n\u25cf\nadapting our products to meet local requirements in countries around the world; and\n\u25cf\nimplementing and enhancing manufacturing, logistics and administrative infrastructure, systems and processes. We intend to continue to hire a significant number of additional personnel, including manufacturing personnel, design personnel, engineers and\nservice technicians. Because our high-performance vehicles are based on a different technology platform than traditional internal combustion engines,\nwe may not be able to hire individuals with sufficient training in electric vehicles, and we will need to expend significant time and expense training the\nemployees we do hire. Competition for individuals with experience designing, manufacturing and servicing electric vehicles is intense, and we may not\nbe able to attract, assimilate, train or retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future, the failure of which could seriously harm our business,\nprospects, operating results and financial condition. If we are unable to adequately reduce the manufacturing costs of Model S, control manufacturing costs for Model X or otherwise\ncontrol the costs associated with operating our business, our financial condition and operating results will suffer. Our production costs for Model S were high initially due to start-up costs at the Tesla Factory, manufacturing inefficiencies including low\nabsorption of fixed manufacturing costs, higher logistics costs due to the immaturity of our supply chain, and higher initial prices for component parts\nduring the initial period after the launch and ramp of Model S. As we have gradually ramped production of Model S, manufacturing costs per vehicle\nhave decreased. While we expect further cost reductions to be realized by both us and our suppliers during the next several quarters, there is no\nguarantee we will be able to achieve sufficient cost savings to reach our gross margin and profitability goals. We incur significant costs related to procuring the raw materials required to manufacture our high-performance electric cars, assembling\nvehicles and compensating our personnel. We may also incur substantial costs or cost overruns in increasing the production capability of Model S and\npowertrain manufacturing facilities and the recent launch in Asia. Furthermore, if we are unable to produce Model X pursuant to our plan due to cost\noverruns or other unexpected costs, we may not be able to meet our gross margin targets. Furthermore, many of the factors that impact our operating costs are beyond our control. For example, the costs of our raw materials and\ncomponents, such as lithium-ion battery cells or aluminum used to produce body panels, could increase due to shortages as global demand for these\nproducts increases. Indeed, if the popularity of electric vehicles exceeds current expectations without significant expansion in battery cell production\ncapacity and advancements in battery cell technology, shortages could occur which would result in increased material costs to us or potentially limit our\nability to expand production. Additionally, we may be required to incur substantial marketing costs and expenses to promote our vehicles, including\nthrough the use of traditional media such as television, radio and print, even though our marketing expenses to date have been relatively limited as we\nhave to date relied upon unconventional marketing efforts. If we are unable to keep our operating costs aligned with the level of revenues we generate,\nour operating results, business and prospects will be harmed. 21\n\n \nWe may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business, which would cause our stock price to\ndecline. We occasionally provide guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance, such as projections regarding the number of\nvehicles we hope to sell, produce or deliver in future periods and anticipated future revenues, gross margins, profitability and cash flows. Correctly\nidentifying the key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process. Our guidance is based in part\non assumptions which include, but are not limited to, assumptions regarding:\n\u25cf\nour ability to achieve anticipated production and sales volumes and projected average sales prices for Model S and Model X in North\nAmerica, Europe and Asia;\n\u25cf\nsupplier and commodity-related costs; and\n\u25cf\nplanned cost reductions. Such guidance may not always be accurate or may vary from actual results due to our inability to meet our assumptions and the impact on our\nfinancial performance that could occur as a result of the various risks and uncertainties to our business as set forth in these risk factors, or because of\nthe way that applicable accounting rules require us to treat new product and service offerings that we may offer. We offer no assurance that such\nguidance will ultimately be accurate, and investors should treat any such guidance with appropriate caution. If we fail to meet our guidance or if we find\nit necessary to revise such guidance, even if such failure or revision is seemingly insignificant, investors and analysts may lose confidence in us and the\nmarket value of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. Our vehicles make use of lithium-ion battery cells, which have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame, and such events\nhave raised concerns, and future events may lead to additional concerns, about the batteries used in automotive applications. The battery pack in our vehicles and the battery packs that we sell to Toyota and Daimler make use of lithium-ion cells. On rare occasions,\nlithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other\nlithium-ion cells. Extremely rare incidents of laptop computers, cell phones and electric vehicle battery packs catching fire have focused consumer\nattention on the safety of these cells. These events have raised concerns about the batteries used in automotive applications. To address these questions and concerns, a number of\ncell manufacturers are pursuing alternative lithium-ion battery cell chemistries to improve safety. We have designed the battery pack to passively\ncontain any single cell\u2019s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells. However, we have delivered only a limited number of our vehicles to\ncustomers and have limited field experience with them. We have also only delivered a limited number of battery packs to Toyota and Daimler. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, which could\ndamage the vehicle or lead to personal injury or death and may subject us to lawsuits. We may have to recall our vehicles or participate in a recall of a\nvehicle that contains our battery packs, and redesign our battery packs, which would be time consuming and expensive. Also, negative public\nperceptions regarding the suitability of lithium-ion cells for automotive applications or any future incident involving lithium-ion cells such as a vehicle or\nother fire, even if such incident does not involve us, could seriously harm our business. In addition, we store a significant number of lithium-ion cells at our manufacturing facility. Any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption\nto the operation of our facilities. While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a\nsafety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations. Such damage or injury would likely lead to adverse publicity and potentially a\nsafety recall. Moreover, any failure of a competitor\u2019s electric vehicle, especially those that use a high volume of commodity cells similar to Tesla\u2019s\nvehicles, may cause indirect adverse publicity for us and our electric vehicles. Such adverse publicity would negatively affect our brand and harm our\nbusiness, prospects, financial condition and operating results.",

  "The Tilburg\nfacility also serves as a pan-European parts warehouse, remanufacturing site and customer service center. The Tesla Gigafactory outside of Reno, Nevada\nWe are developing the Tesla Gigafactory as a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate battery precursor material, cell,\nmodule and battery pack production in one location. We plan to use the battery packs manufactured at the Gigafactory for our vehicles and for our\nstationary storage applications. We broke ground on the Gigafactory in June 2014 and currently expect to produce cells at this site beginning in 2016\nfor use initially in Model S and Model X. The Gigafactory is currently expected to attain full production capacity in 2020, which is anticipated to be\nsufficient for the production of approximately 500,000 vehicles annually as well as for the production of our stationary storage applications. By the time\nthe Gigafactory reaches full, annualized production in 2020, we expect battery pack production capacity to reach 50 GWh. Of this, we expect to build 35\nGWh of cell production capacity at the Gigafactory and purchase 15 GWh of cells from other manufacturers, potentially including Panasonic. We believe that the Gigafactory will allow us to achieve a major reduction in the cost of our battery packs of greater than 30% on a per kWh\nbasis by the end of the first year of volume production of Model 3. The total capital expenditures associated with the Gigafactory through 2020 are\nexpected to be $4-$5 billion, of which approximately $2 billion is expected to come from Tesla. Panasonic has agreed to partner with us on the\nGigafactory with investments in production equipment that it will use to manufacture and supply us with battery cells. We have agreed to prepare and\nprovide the land, buildings and utilities, invest in production equipment for battery module and pack production and be responsible for the overall\nmanagement. We expect to announce other partners as construction progresses. Supply Chain\nModel S uses over 3,000 purchased parts which we source globally from over 350 suppliers, the majority of whom are currently our single source\nsuppliers for these components. We have developed close relationships with several key suppliers particularly in the procurement of cells and certain\nother key system parts. While we obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible, similar to other automobile manufacturers, many of the\ncomponents used in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source. In addition, while several sources of the battery cell we have selected for our\nbattery packs are available, we have currently fully qualified only one cell. We expect to fully qualify additional cells from other manufacturers in 2015. We use various raw materials in our business including aluminum, steel, cobalt, nickel and copper. The prices for these raw materials fluctuate\ndepending on market conditions and global demand for these materials. We believe that we have adequate supplies or sources of availability of the raw\nmaterials necessary to meet our manufacturing and supply requirements. There are always risks and uncertainties, however, with respect to the supply\nof raw materials that could impact their availability in sufficient quantities or reasonable prices to meet our needs. Quality Control\nOur quality control efforts are divided between product quality and supplier quality, both of which are focused on designing and producing\nproducts and processes with high levels of reliability. Our product quality engineers work with our engineering team and our suppliers to help ensure\nthat the product designs meet functional specifications and durability requirements. Our supplier quality engineers work with our suppliers to ensure\nthat their processes and systems are capable of delivering the parts we need at the required quality level, on time, and on budget. Customers and Selected Relationships\nWe currently sell our cars primarily to individual customers. We have strategic or commercial relationships with Panasonic, Daimler, and Toyota. Panasonic\nPanasonic supplies us with battery cells for our battery packs and has partnered with us on the construction of the Gigafactory. In January 2010,\nwe announced that we were collaborating with Panasonic on the development of next-generation electric vehicle cells based on the 18650 form factor\nand nickel-based lithium ion chemistry. In October 2011, we finalized a supply agreement for these battery cells. In October 2013, we entered into an\namendment to the supply agreement to, among other things, provide for the long-term preferential prices and a minimum of 1.8 billion lithium-ion\nbattery cells that we intend to purchase from Panasonic from 2014 through 2017. In July 2014, Panasonic agreed to partner with us on the\nGigafactory. 11\n\n \nDaimler AG\nBeginning in 2008, we commenced efforts on a powertrain development arrangement with Daimler. Since that time, we have developed and\nproduced powertrain components for Daimler for the Smart fortwo electric drive program, the A-Class electric vehicle program and the B-Class electric\nvehicle program. We started to supply production parts for the B-Class electric vehicle program in 2014 and expect to continue to supply parts under\nthis program for the next few years. Toyota Motor Corporation\nIn May 2010, we and Toyota announced our intention to cooperate on the development of electric vehicles, and for us to receive Toyota\u2019s\nsupport with sourcing parts and production and engineering expertise for Model S. Since that time, we have developed and produced a validated\npowertrain system, including a battery, power electronics module, motor, gearbox and associated software, which was integrated into an electric\nvehicle version of the Toyota RAV4. We began delivery of these systems to Toyota for installation into the Toyota RAV4 EV in the first half of 2012. During the third quarter of 2014, we completed the RAV4 EV program. Governmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations\nFull Repayment of United States Department of Energy Loans\nIn May 2013, we paid $451.8 million to settle all outstanding loan amounts due under a loan facility we had entered into with the Federal\nFinancing Bank (FFB) and the United States Department of Energy (DOE), under the DOE\u2019s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan\nProgram, as set forth in Section 136 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (ATVM Program). We refer to the loan facility with the DOE\nas the DOE Loan Facility. Under the DOE Loan Facility, the FFB had made available to us two multi-draw term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $465.0\nmillion beginning on January 20, 2010. As of August 31, 2012, we had fully drawn down the aforementioned facilities. On May 22, 2013, we paid $451.8\nmillion to fully retire our obligations under the DOE Loan Facility. In connection with the closing of the DOE Loan Facility, we had also issued a warrant to the DOE to purchase up to 9,255,035 shares of our\nSeries E convertible preferred stock at an exercise price of $2.51 per share. Upon the completion of our initial public offering on July 2, 2010, this\npreferred stock warrant became a warrant to purchase up to 3,090,111 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $7.54 per share. As a result of\nour repayment of all outstanding principal and interest under the DOE Loan Facility and the termination of the DOE Loan Facility in May 2013, the DOE\nwarrant expired.",
  "For multiple deliverable revenue arrangements, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a\ndeliverable is based on its vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available, third party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated\nselling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Automotive Sales\nWe recognize automotive sales revenue from sales of Model S, including vehicle options, accessories and destination charges, vehicle service. We\nalso recognize automotive sales revenue from the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems, such as battery packs and drive units, to\nother manufacturers. Revenue is recognized when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred and there are no\nuncertainties regarding customer acceptance; (iii) fees are fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection is reasonably assured. 67\n\n \nCar sales include certain standard features and customer selected options and configurations that meet the definition of a deliverable under\nmultiple-element accounting guidance, including internet connectivity, Supercharging access, and specified software updates for cars equipped with\nAutopilot hardware. These deliverables are valued on a stand-alone basis and we recognize their related revenue over our performance period which is\ngenerally the eight-year life of the car or, for software upgrades, as they are delivered. If we sell a derivable separately, we use that pricing to\ndetermine its fair value; otherwise, we use our best estimated selling price by considering third party pricing of similar options, costs used to develop\nand deliver the service, and other information which may be available. As of December 31, 2014, we had deferred $25.6 million related to access to our Supercharger network and $14.4 million related to connectivity. At the time of revenue recognition, we record a reserve against revenue for estimated future product returns."
